*line_break
[b]Rat-tat-tat-tat!!![/b] Bullets whiz over your head, sending you diving for cover behind a bullet ridden wall. Puffs of smoke explode out of the concrete as 7.62mm slugs slam into the walls of the street. You're breathing hard, drenched in sweat as you look at the scraggly squad before you — the last that's left of your platoon. They look to you, eyes peering out from dirty, blackened faces. These are desperate men, in desperate times.
*line_break
*line_break
"Sit-rep!" You bark out.
*line_break
*line_break
"Mike high!" You roll your eyes, morale always had to be high, even in a shit show like this. "Whiskey low! Alpha low!" Your platoon sergeant barks out in a gruff voice. Whiskey… water. Alpha… ammunitions. He looks around, "Fuck me. Total strength 32, current strength 12. 17 dead. 4 missing. 2 wounded."
*line_break
*line_break
Great. Running out of water and ammo, just what you needed. The men aren't enthused either, cowering as another hail of bullets send fragments of brick and mortar flying. ${sergeant}, a tough veteran who had seen more than his fair share of combat, turns to address you.
*line_break
*line_break
"Commander! Enemy across the street, light machine gun spotted! No go! We should retreat!"
*page_break
Glancing around, you realize how exposed your men are. The enemy has the high ground advantage, and it's going to be difficult getting across the street under fire.
*line_break
*line_break
You count eighteen magazines between the twelve of you, three grenades, one smoke grenade and a single rocket propelled grenade - the burdensome RPG. The enemy continue to fire onto your position, a single light machine gun (LMG) spraying bullets. There's at least two others, armed with the standard bad-guy AK-47 getup, taking potshots at your position.
*line_break
*line_break
Swallowing hard, you consider the tactics you could employ as the reliable ack-ack of the AK-47s reverberates through the air.
*line_break
*line_break
1. Toss the smoke before advancing through the smoke screen. This reduces the visibility of the enemy, but also your own soldiers. Besides, smoke never stopped no bullet.
*line_break
*line_break
2. Fire the RPG at the machine gun position and charge. Destroy the biggest threat and hopefully distract the enemy, but it means you sacrifice your only anti-armor weapon left.
*line_break
*line_break
3. Fire and advance, have half your men provide suppressing fire while the rest charge across the street. Straight out of the field manual, this provides cover for the advancing men, but it also means expending your already low amount of ammo.
*line_break
*line_break
4. Retreat, tactically of course. Many men have already died, there's no need to send more men to their deaths really. But doing so means risking arrest and court martial back home for "defying orders".

		"Smoke out! Smoke out!" You grab the long cylindrical grenade, wrenching the pin free before hurling it onto the road. It spins, a plume of white smoke jetting out from its tip, you count in staggered breaths, as taught back in training school. One thousand two thousand three thousand four thousand five thousand. A smoke screen forms, sufficiently covering the street.

		"Go go go go go!!!"

		${sergeant} grabs the nearest soldier and pushes him forward into the bleak whiteness, they sprint forward, boots thumping rapidly against broken bricks, dirt and glass. Following behind, you can barely see the silhouettes of the men in front, despite being barely a few paces away. Ragged breaths break your focus as you gag slightly, the rancid smell of chemicals in the smoke clogging your lungs, strangling you as you chuff away and surge forward.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		A maelstrom of bullets greet your squad. You can't see it, but the ominous boom of the machine gun heralds the assault. The shattering of screaming steel against concrete. The screaming of wretched men.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		[b]TAKE COVER!!! GET DOWN![/b] You see the edge of the road, leaping forward through the smoke to get away from the streets. [i]Fuck![/i] A shard of glass shreds your forearm as you land, but you quickly flatten yourself on the ground.

		*line_break
		A pale, familiar face stares right back at you.
		*line_break

		Blood completely drained, jaws slackened in a horrified tableau. Blood drenches his neck, his body crumpled on the ground. He almost made it. Almost. Another soldier had been shot to pieces. He stood no chance against the LMG. [i]Fucking bastards![/i] You look around, only to see two more of your men collapsed on the ground, dead. Your squad (or the remaining ${men} men) stand ready at the door leading into the base of the enemy building, clearly shaken.

		*line_break
		"Yes Commander!" The RPG gunner smiles. He always liked blowing things up. I mean, who doesn't? "Back-blast check! Clear out!"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		He hoists the RPG over his shoulder, waiting for a lull in the firing. Poor bastard won't even know what hit him. "Fire!!!" The trigger finger jerks slightly, sending the rocket tumbling along its way.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		It spirals dramatically as it flies, spinning clumsily through the air, probably designed by an engineer who had never killed anyone in his/her life. And then probably assembled by a bunch of kids who had never seen their father. And now, it is about to take a few lives with it's eventual, final explosive end.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The rocket flings itself forward, leaving a thin trail of smoke in its wake, lumbering towards the window as the LMG fires wildly. Even from this distance, you see the eyes of the men operating the LMG widen as it dawns upon them. Three young boys, no older than 16 at best. One of them flinches, instinctively covering his face with his hand.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		[b]BOOM!!![/b] The window explodes into a ball of flame, incinerating everything and everyone. The ground tremors slightly, bricks raining onto the tarmac. The barrage of bullet ceases as the LMG position is completely destroyed. Fuck yes!
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Let's go!" The men surge forward as ${sergeant} pushes them on, with you following close behind. Looks like the explosion shook the enemy up bad as everyone reaches the other side unscathed. The squad hurry to the door, two men on each side.

		"Yes commander!" Two of the boys scurry off to the side, taking cover behind a ruined sandbag position. Bullets tear into the barrier, sending dust spewing over the men as they hunker down, hands pulling their helmets tight. "In post! Covering now!" They fire a few wild shots at the enemy position, sending them ducking for cover.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Commander, hang tight, I'll get over first. You, with me!" The fresh-faced recruit nods grimly as the two of them dash across the street, boots smashing into a mix of broken bricks and dirt. Propping your rifle against a broken brick wall, you take a couple of pot shots, making sure to conserve your rounds while doing your best to keep the enemies' head down. It seems to be working!
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"In post! Covering now!" ${sergeant} screams as the two of them hit the deck on the other side of the road, squeezing off a few shots at the enemies above them. The first two soldiers look at you, nodding in affirmation. "Go go go!!"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		At once, you pick up your rifle, sprinting across the treacherous killing ground. Less than 10 yards to go! The dreaded ack-ack of the guns erupt again, a few bullets straying near you as you dive into the dirt, slamming onto the ground! In a flash, you're pressed against the wall, keeping your figure compact as you peer upwards to judge the next move.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"FUCK THEY GOT HIM!!!" You turn, seeing one of the men standing still, his body wobbling slightly as his face contorts in shock, blood pouring down his uniform. His rifle slides out of his hand, clattering to the ground. [b]Bang! Bang!![/b] A puff of red mist explodes in his chest, hurling his body onto the ground like a rag-doll. 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Don't fucking die on me you bastard!!" Another soldier sprints over, defiantly dragging his buddy, desperately throwing the dead man over his shoulder.
