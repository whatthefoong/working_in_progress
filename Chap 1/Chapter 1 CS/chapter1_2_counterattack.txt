As the men go about securing the building, you breathe a sigh of relief. The day had begun like most others - with the higher ups calling for a "grand push". Most days all it meant was firing a few shots in the general direction of the enemy, not that anyone knew where they were, given the ever changing battle lines.
*line_break
*line_break
But today's assault was far more determined, and the high command had ordered for a push into the town, whatever the costs. Many good men and women had died in the fighting on both sides. Even now, the sickening smell of death lingers about the air, brusquely burning your nostrils. At least the fighting is all over for now.
*line_break

You lean against the window, peering out at the smoldering burnt out husks of abandoned schools and destroyed homes. Even amongst the wreckage, a few civilians mill about, scavenging bits and pieces of whatever had not already been looted.

What the hell is that noise? The faint sound of engines and metal drifts across the town.
*line_break
*line_break
Peering carefully out of the window, you spot a retrofitted truck, flanked by two rows of soldiers, but it's hard to make out the exact number from this distance. They had fitted on steel plates over the truck and placed a large cannon atop, one that could possibly shred a house in seconds. Fucking hell. Just when you thought it was over.
*line_break
*line_break
At least they don't seem to be in a rush. And the enemy doesn’t seem to be advancing directly towards your location. Perhaps they still don't know that the town has fallen yet. Not that you would want to take a risk, given that the enemy is headed directly towards you, with a tank to boot.

		*line_break
		*line_break
		“Fan out into teams, but maintain vision of the enemy! Space yourself out in different buildings, take different windows!” Some of your men turn to look at you, confused. Either they were confused by your tactics, were afraid at the thought of splitting up or were simply dazed from the last encounter.
		*line_break

		“What are you waiting for, a please and a thank you? Move your fucking asses!” ${sergeant} spurs the men into action.

		Alright, time to see if this gamble was worth it. Peering through the iron sights, you see the enemy marching alongside their truck. So far so good, they haven't spotted your men yet.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You could fire on the enemy right now. The armored truck is out of the question with your rifles, but cutting their infantry down to size would be great. Or you could wait to see if their leader shows up to take command. Take out the brains of the operation and these untrained soldiers will have no idea what to do. That said, it might never happen, and your window of opportunity gets smaller the longer you wait…

				“Team 1, on my command, open fire at enemy soldiers for 3 seconds. I repeat, 3 seconds. Then take cover.” The enemy continues to march almost nonchalantly, one of them even stopping to take a piss at the side of the road. Just a few more steps, and once the enemy enters the field of fire…
				*line_break
				*line_break
				“Fire!”
				*line_break
				*line_break
				Team 1 opens up on your left, raking the enemy with fire and sending 4 of the enemy soldiers sprawling onto the floor, dead. The rest of the enemy soldiers immediately drop down, screaming in panic and randomly returning fire in the general direction of Team 1. The armored truck grinds to a halt, the cannon’s barrel beginning to swivel round. 
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You won’t give them a chance to react, however.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				“Team 4, now!”
				*line_break
				*line_break
				Another burst of fire from your right. Their bullets hit the enemy on the side, as some of the soldiers who had taken position by the side of the truck have their blood painted on the truck’s side. 
				*line_break
				*line_break
				The enemy troops are in complete disarray, unable to pinpoint your location. Some of them have broken away and are darting for cover.

				*line_break
				*line_break
				You can’t help but smile as your gamble pays off, having successfully cut off the enemy’s forces by half with guerrilla tactics. Well, except for that damn truck, who’s barrel continues to drift left and right, firing indiscriminately. It seems they still have yet to locate your platoon.

							*line_break
							*line_break
							A minute passes, as you envision the RPG team setting up the weapon on the windowsill, taking aim. As the seconds tick by, the barrel of the tank continues to sway hesitantly. You wait with baited breath as time seems to slow down, and you pray nothing comes out of that humongous barrel. You spy the heads of a few enemy soldiers popping out of windows and behind walls, wondering why the gunfire stopped. Once this RPG goes off, they will definitely know your Team 2’s location, but you’re willing to take a gamble on this. 
							*line_break
							*line_break
							You feel like your lungs are going to explode as you continue to hold your breath, bracing yourself for the explosion from either the tank or the RPG, when finally-
							*line_break
							*line_break
							[b]BOOM[/b]
							*line_break
							*line_break
							You flinch. For a second you fear that the tank had opened fire, but as you peer into your scope to look you see a humongous puncture into the side of the tank, smoke and flames billowing out from it. You hear the creaking of steel plating as the tank wheezes its last breath before collapsing into itself. You allow yourself a sigh of relief as you relish in the behemoth’s death. What remains of the enemy begin to crawl out of hiding, retreating away from the battle. It seems that taking out the tank and half their soldiers was enough to deter their advance - and who could blame them.
							*line_break
							*line_break
							You bring the radio up to your mouth. “Great work soldiers, regroup to the last building, over.”
							*line_break
							*line_break
							You turn away from your windowsill, to see ${sergeant} slack-jawed, still in awe at how smoothly that went. You resist the urge to sympathise with them, and instead strap on your pack and give them a light punch to the shoulder as you walk out the door. “Cmon Serg,  let’s go.”
							*else
							The tank remains a thorn in your side, but this position you have set up seems to be highly successful. If you held your ground, could you perhaps see the enemy’s command team rear their ugly head to rally the remaining troops? Then again, the enemy could locate your position at any moment, in which case you’d be squaring off against a metal monster capable of taking your whole platoon out in one shot.
						#Repeat your guerrilla tactics from other buildings. 
							*set counter_attack_score +1
							“That’s a negative soldier, we’re falling back. All troops, regroup to our last building, over.” You feel the greed of taking out that tank tug at you, but you decide to play this a little more patiently. You can use the same tactic once more later, wear their forces down even more.
							*line_break
							*line_break
							“You sure about this Commander?” ${sergeant} comments. You spin around to shoot a look that instantly shuts them up. “Rome wasn’t built in a day, serg. We’re in this for the long haul.” you explain as you put on your pack and walk out the door. “Trust me on this.”
							*line_break
							*line_break
							Your platoon reforms in the building you had captured previously. With everyone accounted for you guide the unit to another set of buildings down the road. Thankfully, the enemy forces are still recovering from your last skirmish, buying your soldiers enough time to clear the new set of buildings and set up their new positions. 
							*line_break
							*line_break
							 When the enemy’s infantry eventually made its way into your killzone, you gave the same commands, and chunked their forces once more before retreating yet again.
							*line_break
							*line_break
							You repeated the tactic 4 more times. Certainly, there were some close calls. 3 of your soldiers received injuries while clearing buildings, encountering some straggling enemies. At one point you narrowly avoided death as the tank fired at the empty building to your left, perhaps out of frustration. To the tank, we were merely flies buzzing around its face, slowing its advance. 
							*line_break
							*line_break
							Eventually, it became apparent to the enemy that they were fighting a losing battle. With their infantry a mere tenth of what it had been, the tank ground to a halt, before reversing. The enemy soldiers left in tow, realising the inevitability of their fallen comrades' sacrifices.
							*line_break
							*line_break
							You watch the tank disappear entirely into the forest, out of the city, before you allow yourself to exhale a sigh of relief. 
							*line_break
							*line_break
							“All teams, don’t get careless, keep an eye out for straggling enemy forces. Regroup onto my position, over.” You try to remain stern in your command, but find it impossible to guise the relief in your tone. 
							*line_break
							*line_break
							It took an entire day of scampering from building to building, slowly wearing down the enemy’s forces. It wasn’t a graceful strategy, there was no heroic moment where the tide was turned in your favour. You were just a platoon of soldiers doing its best to push back a fucking tank. But with your guidance your team came out on top in this war of attrition. 
							*line_break
							*line_break
							 The sound of light  golf claps from ${sergeant} behind you prompts you to turn around, peeling you attention away from the windowsill you had been spying out of.
							*line_break
							*line_break
							“That was… incredible, Commander. I’m sorry I ever doubted your decision.”
							*line_break
							*line_break
							You laugh lightly. “Relax soldier. Letting that tank go might not have been the best idea. But we minimise losses like this while still pushing the enemy back. That’s a win in my book.” Your words trail off as you feel the fatigue start to hit you. You lean up against the brick wall, finally letting your eyes rest, if just for a moment.

There’s a small bridge fording a stream on the outskirts of the village that could provide the perfect bottleneck, catching the enemy as they cross the bridge would leave them with little cover. However, the vegetation on both banks of the stream is sparse, and there’s a high chance that any returning fire would result in high casualties.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Another option is to wait for the enemy to approach, engaging them in the main crossroad of the village. A crumbling church pockmarked with bullet holes provide the perfect vantage point, from which you can rain hell upon the enemy and hopefully take out the majority of their infantry. That being said, the church sticks out like a sore thumb, and if the tank zeros in on the tower... 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Then again, you could just hole up in the debris and ambush them in one of the narrow alleyways. While the window of opportunity is much smaller and the fight will likely devolve into a nasty slug-fest in the rubble, at least the tank won’t be able to intervene too much - or at least that’s what you hope.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		All the options aren’t perfect, but delaying anymore would mean the enemy would soon fall upon you. You have to make a choice. Now.

Yes! You silently cheer as the missile comes into contact with the side of the truck, the initial impact strong enough to send it careening to the left, tilting over before bursting into roaring flames. The enemy soldiers immediately break out into disarray, with some diving for immediate cover, some attempting to rescue the personnel within the truck, and even a couple of lone soldiers charging towards your direction.
*line_break
*line_break
${sergeant} turns to you, anxiously awaiting the next order. “What now, commander? We should use this opportunity to take out the rest of the soldiers while they’re running around like headless chickens.”
*line_break
*line_break
Hmm, the sergeant has a point. Best to strike while the iron is hot, as they say. If you rush out and engage the enemy, you might be able to capitalize on the situation and mop the floor with them. After all, you doubt the enemy are highly trained soldiers, merely nationalistic zealots with an appetite for blood and a trigger happy finger. Having at least received proper military training, your men might be able to overwhelm them with tactical and military expertise.
*line_break
*line_break
However, by charging out into the open, you will be sacrificing your best source of cover. By standing your ground your platoon’s chances of survival would be higher, but given that your men have been fighting for quite some time, you are unsure of the effects the war of attrition might have on your men.
*line_break
*line_break
Lastly, you could choose to make a tactical retreat. After all, your initial objective to scout the location and secure this building are more or less finished. You doubt the few enemy soldiers present would be able to take back this area before reinforcements arrive to push back the enemy’s front lines.

			The disorder brought upon by the initial strike saw the enemy forces too dispersed to launch an organized counter offense.

			Instinctively, you do a quick sweep of your ammunition pouch, only to discover that you are left with two full magazines. Shit.

Although you managed to push back the enemy forces, without enough ammunition to take out their leftover forces you’re as good as sitting ducks.
			*line_break

			“Take cover! The rest of you, take them out immediately!” Inside your head, you cursed and kick yourself for being taken off guard by the enemy’s counterattack so much that you neglected your force preparation before engaging the enemy.

		*line_break

		“Yes commander!” came the chorus of replies. Seems like the men themselves are as eager to get the hell out of this place as you are. While gathering up the rest of your necessities, you notice ${sergeant} gives you an apprehensive glance.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		“Look, ${sergeant}, I don’t like this as much as you do, but you know that we can’t last for much longer. We did as we’re told to the best of our abilities. The enemy knows that we’re here, who knows how many more tanks they are willing to send in? We should pull out when we have the opportunity”
