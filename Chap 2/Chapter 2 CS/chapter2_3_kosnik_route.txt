Being back at the barracks means that you have to fulfill your regular duties. Time flies by as you continue to churn out mission plans, conduct physical and tactical drills, and fulfill your weekly patrol duties. After a few weeks of rest, the aches and bruises incurred from the previous mission has already fade away into a distant memory.
*line_break
*line_break
Thursday night rolls by, and you get ready for your scheduled patrol around the vicinity of the barracks. You sigh, picking up your standard issued military field bag, checking once again that you have enough water to last through the next couple of hours, before heading off to sign out a rifle from the armory - your only companion in this dark, lonely night. An unnecessary precaution, you think to yourself. Nothing ever happens on these boring patrols. Security along the barracks perimeter is already tight enough as it is; only a fool would even attempt to approach it. You take a step outside the heavy wrought iron gates, the cool, crisp breeze a welcoming change to the stale air within. Trudging along, the gravel crunches under your feet noisily, the steady rhythm providing a weirdly comforting solace as it cuts into the still silence of the night.
*line_break
*line_break
The boredom sets in sooner than you expect. You feel a yawn emerging, and make no effort to stifle it out here in the empty road. You can't wait to finish your route as you mindlessly put one foot in front of the other. Within minutes, you approach a familiar fork as the gravel road branches into two opposing but connected paths that meet further back, essentially forming a closed loop. In between them lies another trail, the absence of greenery along a solitary line a sign of countless pair of boots trekking through it the past few months that rejoins the left fork a little further down. You slowly contemplate the possible routes you can take. To your left, the pre-assigned route that you're supposed to take, but to your right, the exact same route but just in a different direction. Or, you could choose to take a shortcut through the middle path and rejoin the patrol route a little further down, cutting down the time you need to finish your patrol.
*fake_choice
	#Take the left route, the pre-assigned patrol route that you've been taking for ages.
		Nope. you're not going to stray off the assigned route. It might be boring, but it'll be over soon before you know it anyway. If the higher ups found out that you took another route than the assigned one… Oh well, better to stick to the tried and tested route. You sigh as you continue to trudge down the long, winding road.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		However, the boredom soon overwhelms you, as you continue down the same old pathway you've been walking through countless times. You decide to break into a jog, partially to keep yourself awake, while knowing that the sooner you complete your route, the sooner you can head back and rest. Picking up the pace, you welcome the cool night breeze that brushes against your cheeks. 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Half an hour later, you've made good progress on your route, plus the endorphin rush keeps you're more awake then ever. Looking back, you realized that you've covered quite a lot of distance. It won't be long now before you reach the fork and start making your way back. Alright! You've probably saved half the time that you usually take. Taking a moment to catch your breath, you lumber down the road.
		*goto 2_4_11_approach_warehouse
	#Take the right route, shake things up a little bit.
		Just take the right path, you think to yourself. What difference will it make? Either way, you'll end up back at this fork again upon completing the patrol. Might as well shake things up a bit to make it a little fresher for you before the boredom overtakes you. Turning away from the usual route, you trudge down the long, winding path to the right.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		A few miles later, you feel your steps getting more lethargic by the minute. Well, this isn't working, you're still bored out of your wits. You try to shake the fatigue out of your system, focusing on the dimly lit path. Good lord, you can't wait to finish this mindless patrol. You can already imagine yourself back in your bunk after a much needed shower.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Oh well, all the more reason to get this over and done with. You quicken your pace slightly, the thought of a good night rest spurring you on.
		*goto 2_4_11_approach_warehouse
	#Head off into the path in the middle.
		No one's gonna find out if I take a minor detour, you think to yourself. Besides, judging from how well worn out the path is, you reckon a few rebellious soldiers had utilized this shortcut as well. Might as well, since it'll save you some time.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You slowly make your way down as the densely packed trees filter out more of the moonlight, leaving the trail barely lit. Coupled with the stillness of the air, the forest seems to give off an eerie feeling, but you feel an odd sense of calm as you push through the increasingly dense vegetation. Surprisingly, you feel right at home walking through the forest path.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		After trekking for twenty minutes, you spot the familiar road illuminated by the streetlights. Alright! You step out onto the gravel, rejoining the initial path you were supposed to take, the openness of the road heralding the cooling night breeze. Judging by the familiar landmarks in your sights, you reckon that you've saved about half an hour or so.

		[b]THUD!![/b]
		*line_break
		*line_break
		A loud noise breaks out from the rundown building up ahead, startling you slightly. You recognize it as one of the olden warehouses belonging to the village in the vicinity. Strange, there shouldn't be any movement within the warehouse by this time of the night. You sneak into the bushes off the side of the road, keeping out of sight while slowly approaching the building to investigate.
		Taking cautious steps, you approach the warehouse steadily. As the distance between you and the warehouse shrinks, you start to pick up more apparent noises - the scraping sound of objects being dragged across the floor, hushed whispers and the occasional grunt - confirming your suspicions. You press your back against the side of the warehouse, feeling the coolness of the concrete through your sweat-drenched uniform. Peeking around the corner, you spot a small van with its doors wide open. Two lean figures stagger out of the warehouse door, clutching a large cardboard box each, the contents heavy judging by the way it was throwing off their gait. Far too focused on their tasks, the two men heave the boxes onto the van before turning, striding towards the warehouse once again.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		As the two move closer, you catch a closer glimpse of the figures before you duck back down behind the wall. Two men, with a similar athletic build, sporting identical buzz cuts, one of them half a head shorter than the other. To your utmost surprise, you recognize their attire: the all-too-familiar MRPA uniform. That revelation threw you off guard momentarily, before you regain your composure and your gears in your brain started to churn, linking all that you've witnessed pointing to an undeniable fact. 		Damn it! How can your own soldiers be looting supplies, from civilians no less?
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You feel your jaw tighten as grit your teeth in frustration. You know you don't have much time to think of the next course of action, as the two men will be emerging from the warehouse any minute now. Best to take action while they are occupied, if you should take action at all.
		*fake_choice
			#Stop their means of escape!
				Disable their means of transportation first, you reason. You sneak around the corner, approaching the van while keeping your figure crouched and as inconspicuous as possible, aided by the low humming of the van's engine. You reach the van in a few lengthy strides and slide around the side away from the warehouse, avoiding the line of sight from the warehouse door.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"Hey! Who the fuck…??" A loud voice booms, sending chills down your neck. You turn and spot a figure fumbling to open the door from the side mirror, Fuck! You forgot to account for the possibility of another person inside the vehicle. With stealth out of the window, you slide your rifle from your side and point it at the man jumping out of the front seat, a stockier figure donning the same MRPA uniform.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"Stop! Put your hands where I can see them or I'll put a bullet in you!" You yell out, squaring the stock of the rifle against your shoulder blade. The driver immediately freezes in place, a look of shock and confusion on his face. You hear urgent footsteps coming towards your direction, no doubt the other two partners-in-crime, alerted by the commotion.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You keep your gun fixed on the driver while stepping away from the van, putting more distance between you and the perpetrators. As the other two figures pop around the front of the van, they start to charge towards you before noticing the rifle pointed straight at them and grinding to an abrupt halt, raising their hands above their heads in surrender.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"Stay where you are, and get on the floor. Any sign of resistance and I'll shoot. Get it?" You repeat yourself for the benefit of the newcomers, a lot calmer this time. The driver looks at the other two, unsure of what to do, while the shorter of the two looters nudges the rest, urging them to get down. A flicker of hesitation, before the other two drop to their knees warily.
				*goto 2_4_13_looters_nego
			#Confront them directly!
				You decide to wait for the two looters to come out of the warehouse before catching them by surprise. You're pretty sure they went into the warehouse completely unarmed, as they need both hands to be unoccupied. Moreover, they probably aren't expecting company. Having a rifle with you now serves as an overpowering advantage.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You steady your breath, listening intently for the signs. A few painfully slow minutes later, you hear the familiar crunching of gravel. Glancing around the corner, you see the two figures reach the van once again, the large boxes in their hands obstructing their views. 				You take the opportunity to burst out of your hiding place and position yourself a safe distance behind the two men, currently preoccupied with unloading the goods.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"Turn around, and put your hands up where I can see them!" You boom, pointing your rifle straight at the two men.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				A reverberating thud echoes through the night as one of the looters drop the box he's carrying onto the floor. Spinning around, the two stare at you with an expression of confusion and anger plastered across their faces, which is quickly replaced by fear as they register the gun in your hands. Their hands immediately shoot up into the air in surrender, their eyes widen in obvious panic.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				A slight movement in your peripheral vision catches your eye. Noticing the passenger door of the van ajar, you shift a few steps to your left, all the while ensuring that your rifle remains pointed towards the two looters. As you gain a clearer field of vision into the front seats of the van, the sight of a slightly chubbier man in the same MRPA uniform cowering in his seat greets your eyes. Looking up, his eyes meet yours and he gives a small yelp and thrusts his empty hands in front of his face. "Don't shoot me, don't shoot me!!"
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"Get out of the van and join the rest. And don't even think about trying anything funny." You growl as you cock your rifle, shifting your glance back at the two MRPA looters. The audible [i]click[/i] of the bullet entering the chamber hints to the three that you mean business. With a whimper, the driver scramble out of his seat, joining the other two with their backs pressing against the van.
				*goto 2_4_13_looters_nego
			#Stay put, you need a little more time to figure things out.
				Okay, you need some more time to assess the situation. On the off-chance that these guys are armed, they can easily put you in a disadvantageous position. You glance back at the van, the side door ajar to reveal the interior half-packed with goods. Oh good. If they aim to maximize the capacity of the van, they will definitely take a while longer, giving you a little more time to work with.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				A sudden movement from the front of the van catches your attention. A stout, stubby little man emerges, exhaling out a cloud of smoke. Damn it, you did not notice the presence of a third person, hidden by a blind spot from your vantage point. As he walks towards the back of the van, towards your hiding place, you attempt to pull your head back behind the wall, though not fast enough, as your eyes meet his for a brief moment.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"Hey! Who the fuck..?" God damn it, your cover's blown. No point keeping yourself hidden then. Not like you have much of a choice now.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You burst out of your hiding place, aiming your rifle straight at the driver. "Don't move! One step and I'll put a bullet in you!" The threat stops the man dead in his tracks.

				You squint your eyes slightly, sizing up the motley crew. Completely unarmed and with the engine still running, they must be preparing for a quick getaway. A stroke of luck then, that you had an impromptu change of plans while patrolling, else the group would have most likely gotten away with it. You vaguely recognize both of the looters, having seen them around the barracks a few times from the other detachments. Not surprising, given the time you have spent in there. To your puzzlement, however, you could not find the face of the driver familiar for the life of you, despite the MRPA emblem sprawled across his right chest.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You look at the trio staring straight back at you, the tension in the air palpable. The silence looms over all of you as you realize that you have no idea what to do in such a scenario. Damn it, you didn't really think this through. Seizing the opportunity, the driver speaks up carefully, his voice smooth and soothing, perhaps intentionally so.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"Ahh… Before you say anything, can I offer you a little… proposition? I'm sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement… commander" He hastily adds the last bit, glancing at the rank insignia on your shoulders.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You narrowed your eyes at him. "I'm listening." His words pique your interest, but nonetheless you keep your rifle trained on them in case they intend to pull a fast one over you.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				The driver clear his throat. "Well, we can offer you a little something for you if you are willing to turn a blind eye regarding this little incident. Something to line your pockets a little with, hmm? Then we can both pretend that this meeting never happened and be on our merry way."
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"Besides," he adds, "most of the villagers have fled to other towns, as you know, being near a military base could potentially mean trouble, should the LOM forces come knocking. As such, the supplies in this warehouse have been left here for quite some time. Since they're just sitting there going to waste, we figured that there's no harm in us using them for our own benefit. Now we're paying you to simply look the other way, everyone gains something eh? How does three hundred bucks sound?"

						You squeeze the trigger, sending a lone bullet flying through the air a few meters above the roof of the van. The loud [i]BANG![/b] reverberates through the air, and the three looters drops to the floor with lightning speed, their hands firmly covering their heads.
						*line_break

						Clambering to their feet, the trio dash along the open road, fleeing the scene as fast as they could. You smirk slightly, watching their silhouettes diminish into a speck into the horizon, before turning your attention back to the warehouse.
						*line_break
						*line_break
						You do a quick sweep of the interior as well as the perimeter of the warehouse, making sure that there aren't any more of them hiding or sneaking around. Once the vicinity is secure, you turn your attention back to the van. Peering into the interior, you find rows of nondescript cardboard boxes packed tightly against one another. The sound of the bottom of the box scraping the coarse lining of the van hits your ears as you drag one out, chucking it down to the floor. The moonlight illuminates the interior of the box, and you are able to distinguish its contents. You push your hands deep within the box, scooping out syringes, pills, bandages, among many other medical supplies.
						*line_break
						*line_break
						Going through the other boxes, you uncover a myriad of provisions and necessities, ranging from canned food to even simple weapons like switchblades or machetes. A mischievous thought pops into your head as you feel the pull of temptation. Maybe those three guys have the right idea. These stuff are merely wasting space, rotting in this warehouse for god knows how long. Maybe it doesn't hurt to "confiscate" some of these for your own sake…
						*fake_choice
							#No you don't! Return the stuff back to the warehouse immediately.
								You feel ashamed that you would even consider grabbing some of these stuff yourself. Heck, you're no better than the looters if you do. Shaking that heinous thought out of your head, you reach for your radio communication device and contact for help back at the barracks. After informing the barracks of the current situation, they assure you that they will contact the relevant personnel from the village. As you wait, you slowly unload the boxes from the van, stacking them on the floor. Son of a bitch, these things are heavy. Though, the weight of these boxes will never compare to the weight of your guilt if you chose to pilfer these for yourself.
								*line_break
								*line_break
								Before long, a couple of civilians arrive at the scene, introducing themselves as the people managing the warehouse. One of them grabs your hand, shaking it with an intense fervor, thanking you profusely, while the rest start to carry the boxes back into the warehouse. Explaining that you're simply doing your job, you reassure the man, advising him to tighten the security measures of the old warehouses.
								*line_break

								Ever the opportunist, you grab as much as you can, prioritizing the smallest but most valuable objects - antibiotics, vitamins, switchblades, and so on. Before you know it, your field bag is bursting at the seams. Given the right connections, you are sure that you can find buyers who will definitely be interested in these, thus making a handsome sum from it.
								*line_break
								*line_break
								Exiting the warehouse, you start to make your way back to the barracks, ignoring the conspicuous van sitting out there in the open. Oh well, it provides the perfect camouflage for your misdeeds. You could claim that you attempted to stop the looters, but sadly they made away with some of the supplies in the warehouse, with no one the wiser.

						*line_break
						"It's like you're not even trying. I could just end this shit show of a negotiation right now, you know?" Raising your rifle, you take your aim at one of the looters. As you took aim, you enjoy the sight of the three looters scurrying in a frenzy.

Keep us safe on our journey back, and you'll get the money after. It isn't safe this time of the night, with thieves and looters abound. Just driving a van like this is as good as painting a bullseye right on our asses, and we don't want to take that risk."
						*line_break
						*line_break
						You look at him incredulously. Does he really not spot the irony in what he just uttered? Nonetheless, you consider his proposition for a moment. The extra income would be really helpful, considering your current financial difficulties. However, if I just take the smaller bribe, I can cut off my involvement with the situation here and now. Taking the bigger bribe might drag me further down this rabbit hole, and who knows where that might lead.

As if on cue, the two soldiers climb in and crouch themselves down within any empty crevice they can find. You chuck your field bag onto the nearest stack of boxes before heading to the front seat with your rifle in your arms.

								The driver wastes no time and floors the pedal the moment you slam the front door shut. The purring of the engine fills the awkward silence between you two, as you stare outside the window, occasionally glancing back at the driver cautiously. After cruising down the road for ten minutes, the vehicle unexpectedly swerves into the forest, and you feel yourself rattling in your seat as the van rolls over an uneven terrain. Your body tenses up as you reach for your rifle, preparing for the worst.

								"Relax, this is just one of our more covert routes. Can't have a hideout without it being hidden, can you?" chuckles the driver, as he continues to swerve deeper into the forest, expertly avoiding the trees before the vehicle comes to a dirt path barely narrow enough to fit a vehicle. The driver then continues to navigate with utmost precision, and you can't help but to wonder how many times have they done this before.

Following a hearty breakfast at the mess hall, you head towards your office to finish the patrol report, as well as draft up the mission brief for the upcoming objective. You park yourself in front of the computer, settling into your usual routine, with the clicking of the keyboard keys the only sound keeping you company.

A few hours later, you feel your eyes becoming extremely dry. You squeeze them shut for a moment, massaging your temples. Some caffeine would be good right about now. The very thought of a nice, warm cup of coffee already starts to warm you from the inside as you head towards the pantry with a purposeful stride.
*line_break

Bursting into the pantry, the odd sight of Sergeant ${sergeant} hunching over and sporting an intense look of concentration catches your attention. Walking over to the table, you spot a miniature radio partially obscured by the sergeant's head. As if finally noticing your presence, ${sergeant} looks up for a moment, his brows still knitted together tightly. You shoot him a quizzical look, cocking your head to one side,
*line_break

"Ah, commander. Come sit with me, you need to hear this. I was flipping through channels when I picked this up." ${sergeant} kicks a chair from under the table, sending it sliding across the floor towards you. Despite your perplexity at the sergeant's odd behavior, you grab the chair and spin it around, sitting yourself down in front of the table as ${sergeant} twists one of the knob, cranking up the volume. A gritty voice cuts through the fuzzy white noise, interrupted by the occasional burst of static.

"… Morovia for Morovians. We must overthrow th… [i]bzzztt[/i]… who call themselves the government, but are in reality Torian dogs. Under their rules, we are but playthings to the Torians.

Before the last sentence can be finished, Sergeant ${sergeant} picks up the radio, and with an angry roar he hurls the radio across the room. With an audible loud smash as it collides with the wall, the radio shatters into a smattering of tiny fragments. The sudden outburst of anger shocks you momentarily, as you have never seen the sergeant so worked up.
*line_break

"What gives, man?!" You walk over to examine the remains of the radio, picking up a few pieces of broken plastic. The force of the sergeant's throw left an obvious indentation in the middle of the wall, as what's left of the radio lies in pieces on the floor, fragmented beyond repaid. Turning back, you notice ${sergeant} still standing, his shallow breaths an obvious symptom of his rage.

You approach the sergeant with utmost caution, fearful that he might take his anger out on his surroundings, or even worse, you. ${sergeant} tilts his head towards the ceiling, inhaling deeply with his eyes closed. "Dude, what's wrong?"

"It's nothing much." ${sergeant} cuts you off brusquely.

"You mean to say you chucked a radio like a major league baseball player for no reason? Seriously, what's bothering you?"  Sliding back into your seat. you cross your arms and rest them against the table top, looking expectantly at the sergeant's hulking figure towering over you. He opens his mouth slightly, but no sound escapes from his lips. Sighing, he knits his brows in frustration, plopping back down as the chair creaks loudly under his large frame.

You've rarely heard the sergeant discuss his family, though you've heard some rumors that he doesn't exactly have a peachy childhood. Given his gruff nature and looks, it's not a exactly dinner conversation material as well.

		"Anyway, if the LOM has already taken control of the area, I'm worried that she might be in danger. Knowing her, I don't think she'll just go quietly without putting up a fight.

A dull, throbbing pain flares up in your head as you try to sit up in your bed, the glare of the morning sun piercing your eyes relentlessly. Man, your alcohol tolerance has really gone down. You used to be able to shake away the headache and go for a half hour morning jog right before breakfast, but now the hangover from the night before hits you like a ton of bricks. You squeeze your eyes shut, trying to will away the grogginess, but to no avail. You could really use a fresh pot of coffee, though judging from the amount of sunlight pouring through the window, you'd be lucky to grab a slice of bread from the mess hall.
*line_break
*line_break
With immense effort, you try to push yourself off the bed despite your vision still appearing to be swaying slightly. As you shoot your hands out beside you to support your weight, your left hand brushes past a smooth surface, a stark contrast to the coarse material of the issued bedsheets, a sense of perplexity registering in your brain. You look down to see an envelope partially tucked under your pillow, a good half of it sticking out as if to intentionally catch your attention. Strange, you spot nothing of the sort the previous night, but no surprises there, seeing that you can't even remember how you got back in the first place.
*line_break
*line_break
You pick up the envelope as your vision starts to blur back into focus. On the middle, your full rank and name are neatly calligraphed in cursive, the handwriting atypical of any military related correspondence you have seen before, piquing your interest even more. Whoever placed it here obviously wanted your full attention. You crassly tear open the back of the envelope and took out a piece of paper deftly folded into half. You unfold the paper and pore over the words written in a similarly organized font.

	[i]Dear Commander,
	*line_break
	*line_break
	You have been so kind as to interrupt our business, and thus we have suffered quite a bit of setbacks directly because of your actions. As such, we believe that you do owe us a little something as repayment. Our requirements are simple: we will require a copy of the patrol route that the guards will use for the following week. Once you have acquired a copy, place it behind the rightmost flagpole facing the gate at 1am tonight. Of course, your efforts will not go unrewarded - we are willing to offer you a little something to fatten your wallet with, and we can assure you that the funds will reach you in a completely discreet manner.
	*line_break
	*line_break
	Now, before you refuse, let me remind you that we know everything about you, including your personal background information. In other words, if you fail to comply to our demands, no harm might befall you, but we cannot ensure that the same thing can be said for your family. We have agents everywhere, so we have the abilities to back up our words. The ball is in your court.
	[/i]
	*line_break
	*line_break
	You re-read the letter a few times, the content shocking you out of your drunken stupor. They must be the same group of people behind the raid on the warehouse a few days back. Damn it! You can't be sure whether the letter is a hoax, but should the words be trusted… No, you refuse to believe that they have means to get to your family. They are safely behind MRPA territory after all. But this doesn't seem to be the work of LOM soldiers. After all, how could one simply walk into a MRPA barracks?
	*line_break
	*line_break
	FUCK! The anger got the better of you as you clench your fist tightly, crunching the piece of paper within. It might be safer to play to their demands, but that would mean that you might compromise the integrity of the barrack's security should you leak the patrol routes. At the same time you cannot risk your family's safety. Or… would it be possible to pull a fast one over these bastards? Send them a fabricated route? No, there are certain risks to that as well. If they happen to realize that you tricked them, the consequences could be worse than you can imagine.

	[i]Dear Commander,

	*line_break
	First and foremost, we would like to extend our thanks for your kind help with our endeavor two days ago. It is nice knowing that someone isn't as… upright as some would expect. Anyway, as a way of thanking you, we would like to make you a similar offer once again. Our request is simple, We will need a copy of the patrol route that the guards will use for the following week. Once you have acquired a copy, place it behind the rightmost flagpole facing the gate at 1am tonight. Once we receive it, we can assure you that the funds will reach you in a completely discreet manner.

	You can choose to ignore this letter, but let me assure you, you will be better off with our aid. We know that your family condition is somewhat financially… delicate, and if you do us the proper favors we can assure you that the debt will not go unpaid. We expect good things from you, and eagerly await your response.

	You stare at the letter incredulously, re-reading it a few times. It seems that the looters that you helped the other day aren't as simple as they appear to be. Their proposition seems tempting, but that would mean potentially compromising the integrity of the barrack's security should you reveal the patrol routes. Of course, there's always the option to ignore the letter, removing yourself from any further affiliations with this unknown group. Better yet, you could send them a fake patrol route to mess with them a little, though the way that they managed to dig up information about your family circumstances are a little disconcerting…

			*if stop_looters = 1
				The barracks be damned, you simply can't risk the safety of your family. Besides, it'll take an organized assault of a huge scale to completely eliminate the sheer number of trained soldiers in this place, whereas your family is completely unprotected. If you rationalize it this way, the choice becomes painfully obvious.
			*if stop_looters = 0
				Damn it! It's simply an offer you can't refuse. In any case, what major damage can leaking the patrol routes cause to the barracks? It'll take an organized assault of a huge scale to completely eliminate the sheer number of trained soldiers in this place, and bypassing the patrol routes won't change that. No harm in making a quick buck.

			After a quick washing up, you head down to the office, making sure to go about your usual tasks in order to avoid looking suspicious. The hours roll by painfully, as the other commanders and officers start to leave the office in droves, having finished their work for the day. You pretend to be poring through a document on your computer, typing away furiously at "edits" that will be deleted in a few minutes. Once the door swings to a close as the last person leaves the room, you boot up the necessary documents: the map of the surrounding areas of the barracks and an overlay showing the route for the upcoming week's patrol.

			Taking a cursory glance across the office and confirming that you are well and truly alone, you slam the print button. The erratic whirring of the printer unnerves you as you keep stealing glances at the door, half expecting it to fly open suddenly. The moment the paper slides out onto the printing tray, you snatch it and stuff it into a plain, white envelope, shoving it down your left pocket as you take your leave.

You breathe a sigh of relief as you reach the flagpole uninterrupted. Your eyes dart around your surroundings, and only when you're convinced that you're really alone that you slip the letter out of your pocket and drop it to the floor, giving the envelope a swift kick, driving it as close to the base of the flagpole as possible. Breaking into a brisk trot, you make a beeline for your bunk, without turning back for even an instance.

				How dare they threaten you?! You can just take the high road, but now they've made it personal, especially after threatening your family. Well, you don't have to play by their rules. A false route should be able to throw a wrench in their plans just fine. Oh, you can already taste the confusion and mayhem it'll cause, the sweetness lingering in your mouth.			
			*if stop_looters = 0
				Just because you happen to be caught up in the looting fiasco, that does not mean that you are a tool for this mysterious organization as they please.

"Alright, you ready for our patrol, commander?" A doe-eyed rookie soldier blurts out enthusiastically. It's once again time for your weekly patrols, but since you're taking the morning shift, there will be two more privates tagging along. You sling your usual gear over your shoulders, giving the recruits a short grunt before taking off on your own, the two quickly shuffling behind you.
*line_break
*line_break
A while later, the three of you trek through a familiar stretch of road near the village lying northeast of the barracks, separated by a large area of vegetation. Turning to your right, you spot a large group of villagers in the clearing a short distance from here through the gaps in the trees. You continue to saunter down your patrol route before grinding to a sudden stop, doing a double-take back at the clearing. Wait a dang minute, you find the uniform sported by a couple of the figures oddly familiar. Halting your men, you signal for them to remain quiet and stay close to you. The two privates exchange a perplexed stare, before following you as you crouch down and weave your way through the trees.
*line_break
*line_break
As you and the two privates inch closer towards the clearing, you gain a clearer sight of the villagers. Sure enough, the distinct pattern of the old military uniform, coupled with that unmistakable logo on their sleeves, dispels any doubt that you have. What are these LOM bastards doing here? Terrorizing the villagers?
*line_break
*line_break
"On my command, we go out there and take those LOM fuckers down. But careful with that gun, there're tons of civilians around, so don't go trigger happy, you hear me?" You whisper to the two privates as your group continue to move towards the villagers. The two nod furiously, their furrowed brows and cold sweat a clear sign of nerves. Poor bastards, they probably don't have a lot of practical experience out in the field.

Deep breaths. One. Two. Three

"Okay, go go go!"

You take the initiative and charge out headfirst into the clearing, rifle at the ready. At the sight of a fully armed soldier bursting out of the forest, the villagers break out in chaos, screaming and attempting to take cover, but you pay no heed to them, your sights focused on those wearing the LOM uniform. Before you can take aim and open fire, you hear one of them yelling out, "Stop! Don't shoot! We're here in peace, I swear!"

You hear gun shots coming from behind you as you see yet another LOM soldier hitting the ground from the corner of your eyes.
