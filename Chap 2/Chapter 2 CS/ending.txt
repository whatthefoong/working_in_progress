*if char_type = "IITI"
	a inventor, who is always curious to find out why things are. $!{playerheshe} is always coming up with new ideas and information, mostly because the world is simple and straightforward to ${playerhimher}.

It's the thought that counts!

	the type who always explores and jumps and new ideas. Always creating, innovating and finding ways to do things different, ${playerheshe} loves creating new things. Relaxed and creative, ${playerheshe} always strives to express ${playerhimher}self in different ways. Sometimes, that makes it hard for others to truly value ${playerhimher}.
