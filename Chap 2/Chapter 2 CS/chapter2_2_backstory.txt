What brings you here indeed.

At the macro level, it had all started with the declaration of independence, with the Torian colonial masters granting Morovia a new lease of life and creating an immediate power struggle. Not to say that the violence was unprecedented, after all, the road to independence had been a hasty and rocky one. Morovia had been under the colonial rule of the Torians for centuries, as did most of the neighboring countries. Years of independence advocacy by activists had fallen on deaf ears or simply led to quick arrests and long jail sentences. But a recent wave of nationalism that had rushed across the peninsula, giving the latent dissatisfaction for colonial rule a voice and a movement. Large scale marches and protests were organized, with hundreds of thousands of Morovians marching on to the capital in Strazova.
*line_break
*line_break
The Torians weren't willing to risk life and limb for a foreign colony situated half-way around the world. Despite their well-drilled armies and technological superiority, they were outnumbered more than 50 angry Morovians to each Torian soldier. Besides, what they lacked in manpower, they made up for in money. Tons of money. Within months, the Torians had hand-picked a new Morovian government and paved the way for the independence of the newly minted People's Republic of Morovia while retaining key positions in industry and having an advisory role to the nation.
*line_break
*line_break
President Montaro, the newly "elected" president of Morovia, saw this relationship as mutually beneficial, after all, Morovia needs external support to grow. Most Morovians lacked the skills, experience and education to lead an entire nation or run the various resource extraction companies, and the Torians provided much needed financial, governance and military expertise.
*line_break
*line_break
With the financial backing of the Torians and the need for an independent army, the Morovian government started running a series of recruitment drives to started to entice many able-bodied men and women to join the Morovian Republic People's Army, the MRPA, with the promise of a stable paycheck and a noble career. Thus, you had decided to pack your bags and head straight to the nearest recruitment center, which thereafter they shipped you off to the nearest MRPA drill camp.
*line_break
*line_break
However, one of the major Morovian warlords - General Kontessa, saw this arrangement and mustering of forces as a mere masquerade of Torian imperialist colonialism. He demanded for the immediate withdrawal of the Torians and a true "Morovia for Morovians", which was, of course, unconditionally denied. It is said that he had thrown a fit of rage, swore at President Montaro and called him a "fucking Torian monkey", before storming off. Within days of the independence, General Kontessa had mobilised the soldiers loyal to him, as well as convinced many of the MRPA generals to join him to "free Morovia from the hands of colonial tyranny and oppression". In stereotypical coup fashion, General Kontessa announcemed a coup and launched an assault on Strazova.
*line_break
*line_break
At least, that's what you had gathered through a patchwork of sources, from the general in-barrack gossip and banter to the official bulletins and illicit radio broadcasts. Nobody really knew what was happening, or who was right, or what was right. The only truth was that Morovia was being torn to shreds by the civil war, with the MRPA and LOM fighting a fierce battle for control, and possibly, the future of Morovia.

Thinking back, you remember the day you had made the fateful decision - filling out the forms and going through the proper procedure under the hawkish scrutiny of the drill sergeants. A few weeks earlier, a smartly uniformed soldier had pressed a flyer into your hands - urging you to do your part for Morovia and join the Morovian Republic People's Army, or MRPA for short. 
*line_break
*line_break
Morovia never had it's own army - after all, it had been a Torian colony for the past 150 years. The Torian colonial masters ran the entire country, from it's governance, economy, education, health-care and security. Having established large-scale operations and Torian conglomerates to extract the many natural resources in Morovia, the Torians (and a highly select group of Morovians) became extremely wealthy, while the rest of the country struggled to make a living working in the Torian plantations and mines.
*line_break
*line_break
This, amongst other reasons, led to a surge in pro-independence support in Morovia. Morovians were disgruntled at the increasingly extravagant lifestyles of the Torians, and with other Torian ex-colonies such as the neighboring Hada successfully negotiating for independence, national sentiment for self-governance grew at an increasing rate. Marches and peaceful demonstrations were organized, and to the great surprise of everyone, the Torians had made the unprecedented decision to call for snap democratic elections (having already prepared their own cherry-picked party, the Morovian People’s Party, or MPP). With the various political parties scrambling to organize themselves, the MPP won easily and were hastily established as the government (and puppet) of Morovia.
*line_break
*line_break
The new Morovia needed it's own army, and hence started to run massive recruitment drives to quickly train and staff up. That was how you ended up in the army. But even then, it wasn't a spur of the moment decision back then, and walking into the dusty barracks was a culmination of many factors, but ultimately it was the…

		*line_break
		*line_break
		"What can I say? The army provides a steady, sizable income. Comparatively, a military career is more lucrative than any other career option I had at the time, at least. As Morovia moved towards independence, the government wanted more soldiers; young people like me. And so I thought, why not?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"It seemed like a good opportunity, and with the escalating tensions, I knew I could quickly rise the ranks."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Granted, the trainings were physically and mentally exhausting, but you managed to rise above that. It was easy to outshine most of the other recruits, and you soon caught the eye of your commanders, which gave you an opportunity to take up command positions within a MRPA battalion, and before long you rose to the rank of a Lieutenant and given the command of your own platoon. Of course, a higher rank means a better pay as well.

In fact, much of your childhood has been spent with your parents educating you on business strategies, how to read and negotiate with people, smooth-talking them over to get things done your way.

		Coming from a long line of Morovian farmers, your family has been involved in the agriculture industry for ages. As a matter of fact, your grandparents were able to afford a few hectares of land, and since then your family has been able to make a comfortable living by selling off fruits and produce. Of course, the occasional drought or flood meant that the year's bounty is at the mercy of the weather, but your family's experience in the field has allowed them to take countermeasures by diversifying their crops. Your time spent on the plantations as you were growing up were pretty enjoyable as well, where any free time not helping out in the field is spend weaving through the trees in the vast plantation, climbing trees and picking fruits as you deem fit. Your family wasn't filthy rich, but they managed to provide you with a decent life.

		These days, however, things were not going as well as they used to be. By a stroke of luck, the conflict between the LOM and the MRPA has not spread to the immediate vicinity of your hometown, but the rising tension has led to fewer workers willing to continue working in the fields, citing either the potential to be caught up in the firefight or the need to return back to their own villages to ensure the safety of their families as a reason to leave. As the number of workers dwindled, there is only so much your family themselves can handle, and as such they had to resort to selling half the plantation off to wealthier merchants.

			Dropping the clipboard to her side, Sonia glances up and meets your eye with a reassuring smile. "Anyway, I've completed your checks. Your body's holding up pretty well so far. A few more days of quality rest, and you could even be walking out of the hospital yourself. Emphasis on the rest, got it?"

	#humble and hardworking miners.
		*set background 3

		Your family has been making a living in the mines for as long as you can remember, you yourself are no exception. In your early childhood years, you have been helping out by panning for ores by the riverside. As you got older, you started accompanying the older men deeper into the mines to excavate whatever precious metals you can lay your eyes on.  Sure, the work was taxing, but on the bright side you did manage to tone your body better than any gym routine could provide. Although your family made barely the minimum wage, they made do with the simpler things in life, preferring to be contented with what you already have, than coveting for more material possessions.

		However, as the conflict escalated, parts of the mine were seized by the government, laying claim to the minerals excavated in order to help fund the war effort. As most of the minerals are being siphoned off to fatten the MRPA reserves, your family is getting even less than the paltry sum they were originally given, but hey, at least they still have a job. However, you can't help but worry about your family making ends meet.

		"My family has been working in the mines down at Ruzno for a couple of generations now. Recently it seems that the MRPA has established their presence at the mines, so I'm not sure how things are at the moment. I haven't been in contact with them for awhile now…"

			Sergeant $!{sergeant} falls silent for a while, before looking back at you. "You know, my parents used to work in the mines… Now it's just my mom. But that's a story for another time. Anyway, what I want to say is this: miners are fucking tough, tougher than you think. If anything happens, I'm sure they'll be able to deal with it. So chin up, brother, I'm sure your family is doing well"

			The sergeant's words lights up a small spark of hope in you, and unknowingly you find yourself smirking at him, with a mumbled thanks.

			"Alright, it ain't getting any earlier. I gotta go check up on the other men. You have a good rest, commander."

			With that, Sergeant $!{sergeant} swings his muscular frame around the seat of the chair and stumble onto his feet. Placing both his hands on your shoulders, he gives you one last pat before turning around, brusquely brushing aside the flap of the tent and stepping back outside.

			"I know you're worried about your family, but it's not like you can do anything about that while you're lying in bed here. My advice is, follow the doctor's orders, and the faster you get better, the faster you can contact your family and make sure all is well with them." Sonia chides, giving the impression of a mother scolding a belligerent child.

			You hate to admit it, but she's right - you can't do anything while you're confined to your bed right now. You give a weary sigh before nodding your head in compliance.
