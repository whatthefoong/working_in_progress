Thinking back, the choice you made to join the military wasn't one that was made in the spur of the moment, but rather through intense deliberation. There were a lot of factors that cumulated into this major decision, but ultimately the biggest driving force for you is…
*fake_choice
	#Money! The military pays well, and I could use the steady paycheck.
		*set join_rationale 1
		You sigh. The reason seems superficial, but you can't deny that it was, and still is, in fact, a pressing concern.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"What can I say? The army provides a steady, sizable income. Comparatively, a military career is more lucrative than any other career option I had at the time, at least. Not to mention, the escalation of tension within the country proved to be an advantageous moment. The government wanted more soldiers; young people like me. And so I thought, why not? It's the perfect opportunity."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		True enough, the conflict could not have come at a more opportune time. As the riots and protests of the Liberators Of Morovia, the LOM, became more bloody and violent, the demand for soldiers to suppress such threats saw a constant increase. The Morovian government started to entice many able-bodied men and women to join the Morovian Republic People's Army, the MRPA, and are more than willing to pay a higher rate. Thus, you decided to pack your bags and head straight to the nearest recruitment center, which thereafter they shipped you off to the nearest drill camp.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Granted, the trainings were physically and mentally exhausting, but you managed to rise above that. Given your above-average performance, you soon caught the eye of your commanders, which gave you an opportunity to take up command positions within a MRPA battalion, and before long you rose to the rank of a captain, having command of your own unit. Of course, a higher rank means a better pay as well.

				#thriving entrepreneurs with booming businesses.
					*set background 1
					*set charm +1
					Your family has always been running a couple of small businesses here and there. After all, your father was a Hadan migrant that came to Morovia to expand his trade business, bringing cheap supplies from Morovia back into Hada, as well as make use of the cheaper labor and manufacturing costs of Morovia, which was how he came to meet the blossoming young daughter of a local factory owner, whom he married a few years after. In fact, much of your childhood has been spent with your parents educating you on business strategies, how to read and negotiate with people, smooth-talking them over to get things done your way. "The art of the deal", as your father likes to call it. Sadly, with the independence of Morovia from Torim, the withdrawal of Torian investment dealt a large blow to your family's ventures. Without the proper finances. they simply could not compete with the larger conglomerates.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					Before long, your family's businesses ran dry and collapsed upon itself. Luckily, your family has a sizable saving. Coupled with the inheritance from the previous generations, your family's coffers would at least be able to last for a quite a while. However, you know that this is only a temporary solution, as the cost of living and basic necessities are rising exponentially as the conflict means that resources are getting scarcer by the day. 
					*line_break
					*line_break
					*if kosnik =1
						However, you're not sure if you should mention your half Hadan heritage to the sergeant. You've known him long enough to know that the nationalistic sentiments within the man flows strongly and proudly. Any questionable part of your heritage would only diminish your credibility. No, better to conveniently leave out that part and let him see you as his trusty comrade-in-arms, striving for a better Morovia.
						*line_break
						*line_break
						"My parents were entrepreneurs, but they couldn't sustain their business when the Torians left the country. With a failing business, I must do what I can to help support my parents and my siblings." You muttered.
						*line_break
						*line_break
						"Man, that's tough, but on the bright side at least we're not dependent on those Torian bastards any more, right? I mean, the Torians and Hadans did take advantage of our people, our land, our resources. No sir, Morovia should belong to the Morovians! And hey, once we get back on our feet, I'm sure your family business would pick up again." Sarge threw the butt onto the floor, grinding it with the tip of his boot. "Ah well, at least things are starting to pick up with you here in the MRPA huh? I bet your family has less to worry about now that you're picking up the slack. Hey, anytime you need help, you feel free to approach me yeah?"
						*line_break
						*line_break
						With that, Sergeant $!{sergeant} swings his muscular frame around the seat of the chair and stumble onto his feet. Placing both his hands on your shoulders, he gives you one last pat before turning around, brusquely brushing aside the flap of the tent and stepping back outside.
					*if sonia =1
						You sigh, hesitantly explaining to Sonia your parent's failing businesses while trying to gloss over your heritage as much as you can. You don't really like mentioning the fact that your father comes from Hada, especially with tensions running high within the country, and being from a mixed family might trigger some… extreme reactions from more nationalistic idealists. But with Sonia, you feel that she would be more understanding at least.
						*line_break
						*line_break
						Although Sonia continues to tinker with the medical equipment in your room, her reduced pace suggests her increasing investment and interest in your story.
						*line_break
						*line_break
						"Well, to me a patient is a patient. That's all that really matters to me, at least. To be completely honest, I don't really care if you're Hadan or Morovian, or even fully Torian. Heck, a bullet wound doesn't discriminate, so why should I?" 
						*line_break
						*line_break
						Dropping the clipboard to her side, Sonia glances up and meets your eye with a reassuring smile. "Anyway, I've completed your checks. Your body's holding up pretty well so far. A few more days of quality rest, and you could even be walking out of the hospital yourself. Emphasis on the rest, yeah?"

				#middle class farmers and landowners. 
					*set background 2
					*set finesse +1
					Coming from a long line of Morovian farmers, your family has been involved in the agriculture industry for ages. As a matter of fact, your grandparents were able to afford a few hectares of land, and since then your family has been able to make a comfortable living by selling off fruits and produce. Of course, the occasional drought or flood meant that the year's bounty is at the mercy of the weather, but your family's experience in the field has allowed them to take countermeasures by diversifying their crops. Your time spent on the plantations as you were growing up were pretty enjoyable as well, where any free time not helping out in the field is spend weaving through the trees in the vast plantation, climbing trees and picking fruits as you deem fit. Your family wasn't filthy rich, but they managed to provide you with a decent life.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					These days, however, things were not going as well as they used to be. By a stroke of luck, the conflict between the LOM and the MRPA has not spread to the immediate vicinity of your hometown, but the rising tension has led to fewer workers willing to continue working in the fields, citing either the potential to be caught up in the firefight or the need to return back to their own villages to ensure the safety of their families as a reason to leave. As the number of workers dwindled, there is only so much your family themselves can handle, and as such they had to resort to selling half the plantation off to wealthier merchants.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					You sigh out loud. "My family used to own a few plantations in Madre, but last I heard a few months ago, they're struggling with the manpower needed to maintain the plantations, with the conflict and whatnot. I haven't been able to contact them since, and I'm in the dark of any current developments in the area. It's worrying, to say the least."
					*line_break
					*line_break
					*if kosnik =1
						Sergeant $!{sergeant} pulls the chair closer. "Shit, man. I had no idea. I'm sure they're safe, didn't recent reports mention that Madre is still free from LOM influence? That should give you a peace of mind for now, right?
						*line_break
						*line_break
						You turn to Sergeant $!{sergeant} and smile weakly. "Yeah, I guess. I'll just have to wait and see then. Thanks."
						*line_break
						*line_break
						"Alright, it ain't getting any earlier. I gotta go check up on the other men. You have a good rest, commander."

						With that, Sergeant $!{sergeant} swings his muscular frame around the seat of the chair and stumble onto his feet. Placing both his hands on your shoulders, he gives you one last pat before turning around, brusquely brushing aside the flap of the tent and stepping back outside.

My advice is, follow the doctor's orders, and the faster you get better, the faster you can contact your family and make sure all is well with them." Sonia chides, giving the impression of a mother scolding a belligerent child.
						*line_break
						*line_break
						You hate to admit it, but she's right - you can't do anything while you're confined to your bed right now. You give a weary sigh before nodding your head in compliance.

				#humble and hardworking miners.
					*set background 3
					*set physical +1
					Your family has been making a living in the mines for as long as you can remember, you yourself are no exception. In your early childhood years, you have been helping out by panning for ores by the riverside. As you got older, you started accompanying the older men deeper into the mines to excavate whatever precious metals you can lay your eyes on.  Sure, the work was taxing, but on the bright side you did manage to tone your body better than any gym routine could provide. Although your family made barely the minimum wage, they made do with the simpler things in life, preferring to be contented with what you already have, than coveting for more material possessions.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					However, as the conflict escalated, parts of the mine were seized by the government, laying claim to the minerals excavated in order to help fund the war effort. As most of the minerals are being siphoned off to fatten the MRPA reserves, your family is getting even less than the paltry sum they were originally given, but hey, at least they still have a job. However, you can't help but worry about your family making ends meet.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					"My family has been working in the mines down at Ruzno for a couple of generations now. Recently it seems that the MRPA has established their presence at the mines, so I'm not sure how things are at the moment. I haven't been in contact with them for awhile now…"
					*if kosnik =1	
						*line_break

						Sergeant $!{sergeant} falls silent for a while, before looking back at you. "You know, my parents used to work in the mines… Now it's just my mom. But that's a story for another time. Anyway, what I want to say is this: miners are fucking tough, tougher than you think. If anything happens, I'm sure they'll be able to deal with it. So chin up, brother, I'm sure your family is doing well"

However, a faction of the military were unhappy that many Torians still held important positions in the political and financial sector, and as such broke away and declared a coup under the name of the Liberators of Morovia, the LOM. The ensuing uprisings and sieges escalated far quicker than anyone expected, and the tension swept the entire nation into a state of frenzy.
