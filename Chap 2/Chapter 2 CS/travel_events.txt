A small speck in the distance catches your eye, and you wonder if that's a person slowly making its way along the road. Only upon getting closer do you realize that it is a fairly large dog, slowly ambling along the road in the same direction. You slow down considerably and steer slightly away from the curb, careful not to accidentally brush against the dog. As your vehicle approaches, the sound prompts the dog to perk its head up and turn towards you, its tongue hanging loosely out of its mouth. You bring the car to a complete stop as the dog stares straight into your eyes, holding your gaze. There's no civilization for miles around, so this must be a stray, but strangely enough it seems fairly tame.

You reach out a hand, but the dog shudders and back away slightly.

		An idea pops into your head. You head back to your car and reach into your backpack, digging around furiously before pulling out what you're looking for: a peanut butter sandwich. Tearing away the plastic wrap, you jog briskly back to the dog, who remains rooted the same position you left it. Tearing a sizable chunk of the sandwich, you gently lower it a few paces in front of the dog. You can see that your action piques its interest. Pacing forward, the curious canine sniffs at the piece of sandwich, before gobbling it up with a newfound fervor. You smile, approaching the ravenous dog with the rest of your sandwich, and it takes several bites straight out of your hand. With the other hand, you reach out and stroke its torso gently. As it finishes the last remaining bite, you pick up the poor dog and carry it back to your car with surprisingly no resistance. As it settles down in your passenger seat, its body pulsing while it pants, you buckle up and drive off.

		Before long, you arrive at your destination. You glance sadly at your new friend, knowing that it can't possibly stay with you for long. You can't possibly bring it along on all your missions. You bend down, slowly explaining to the dog that this is where you say your goodbyes as you nuzzle its face one last time. The dog looks at you for awhile, before trotting away, wandering into the streets. You give it one last look before turning away, heading into your destination.
	#Leave it alone.
		You break away from the canine's gaze. No, you can't just go around picking up strays. It's made it long enough till now, it'll survive for a while more at least. You try not to look at the poor dog, pushing the thoughts of it out of your mind as you slowly drive off, continuing the journey to your next destination.

The approaching car swerves into the adjacent lane, matching your speed. Catching your attention, you can't help but to glance sidewards. A bright red convertible with its top down greets your eyes, the driver a young man in his mid 20s. With one hand, he raise his shades and look at you in a condescending manner, before smirking to himself, his arms resting against the edge of the car. Out of nowhere, he honks twice before speeding up and cutting into your lane, and you can see his head rearing back in laughter.
*line_break

That's it. You were planning on ignoring the entire situation, but this young punk has to be put in his place. You floor the accelerator and swerve into the adjacent lane, keeping up with his speed. Your vehicle might not have the capacity to take him on a full blown race, but you still can outmaneuver this bastard. You speed on slightly ahead, such that your car inches slightly more forward than his. You turn around and see the panic in his eyes as he tries to break away, but you are giving him little to no breathing space as you sandwich him between your vehicle and the curb.
*line_break
*line_break
Time for the finishing touch. With a quick jerk of the steering wheel, you swerve your vehicle to the side slightly, causing the boot to nudge the front of his convertible. A mere light brush, but the speed of his car meant that the momentum is amplified, and the impact sends his car careening to the side. You quickly speed off to avoid the ensuing impact, chuckling to yourself as you see his car spinning several rounds before hitting the curb. Hey, who knew you were such a good driver?

As you drive along the road, you spot a small, calm lake shimmering in the sun. You could really use a break, you think to yourself as you pull up to the nearby clearing. Grabbing your backpack, you slam the door shut, heading to the edge of the lake. In the distance across the lake, you spot a group of children sitting on the edge of a pier, giggling and playing about, their feet kicking up waves of water at their peers. Upon seeing you, they wave enthusiastically at you, and you can't help but wave back. You take off your boots and socks and lay them on the shore, before placing your backpack next to your shoes, grabbing a sandwich from within.

Following the children's example, you wade slightly into the shoreline, enjoying the gentle lapping of miniature waves on your toes, a feeling that puts you at ease almost immediately. You take a large bite of the sandwich, your eyes gazing lazily at the lake's reflection, a perfect mirror of the landscape in the distance.
*line_break

"Help, help!" A voice cries out, drawing your attention. You turn to the children, and to your shock you notice a boy flailing helplessly in the water. You leap into action almost immediately, dropping your sandwich and diving into the water, taking the shortest possible path to reach the drowning boy. Breathe, pull, breathe, pull. With steady and powerful strokes, you close the distance between you and the group of children, and before long you reach the boy, whom is struggling to stay afloat at this point. Wasting no time, you place your arms around him and tilt him backwards, leaning against your torso as you kick against the water, pushing you back towards the nearest shoreline.

Before long, you feel your feet kicking against the sandy seafloor as you approach the shallows. You swing the boy around, carrying him on your back as you slowly crawl up to the edge of the shore as you hear the boy coughing relentlessly. The children frantically dash towards the two of you, their faces a look of worry and terror. You slowly lower the boy on his back as he continue to wheeze and sputter, and you take the moment to catch your own breath.
*line_break

After a couple of minutes, you turn to the group of children gathering around the boy, hugging him tightly as tears streak down their faces. "What do you think you all are doing?! If you don't know how to swim, don't horse around a lake! If I wasn't around, you could have been in serious trouble!" The children look visibly startled, and a few of them starts bawling outright. They probably aren't expecting a full blown lecture from someone who just saved their friend, but you feel that you have to knock some sense into them. Seeing their pitiful looks, you soften considerably. "Just be more careful in the future, alright? You all better be going home before your parents start to worry."

*line_break
Nodding in shame, the children wipe their tears and slowly shuffle away supporting their still dazed friend, but not before uttering a quick "thank you". Sighing, you make your way back to where you left your bag and shoes. With a quick change of clothes, you pick up your stuff and head back to your vehicle, and soon you're continuing your journey to your destination.

The road stretches ahead, seemingly endless. You sigh as you put your hand to your chin, keeping one hand on the steering wheel. You can't wait to get to ${location_choice_name} as soon as possible.

All of a sudden, you spot a couple of buildings in the distance. You decide to pull up and take a break, looking for an opportunity to stock up on some essentials while you're at it.
*line_break
*line_break
Navigating your way through the village, you notice that the buildings are in an extremely rundown state. In fact, it takes you a while to find an operational store; most storefronts are tightly guarded by a sheet of metal shutters.
*line_break
*line_break
You hesitantly enter the store, a small nook amidst a dilapidated row of shops. The facade, you notice, has slowly begun to fall apart as patches of paint are peeling off, pooling into a small pile of chipped off pieces on the floor. You glance around - much of its stock are in disarray, strewn all over the shelves. You grab a nearby loaf of bread, noticing that said loaf is slightly hard to the touch, the bottom left corner with a slight tinge of green mold.
*page_break
"Ahem. Can I help you, good sir?" A low, husky voice coughs, catching you by surprise. You spin around and notice an old, feeble man sitting on a stool, as unmoving as a statue. His stillness, coupled with his small frame, must be the reason you completely missed his presence.
*line_break
*line_break
You place the bread back down, wiping your hands on your pants as you slowly make your way towards the shopkeeper. "Why is the place so empty? There's hardly anyone out there in the streets."
*line_break
*line_break
"Ahh. You see, there has been an increase in military activities around these parts. Coupled with some nasty rumors about how soldiers are planning on storming this place soon, many people in this villange can't help but to start swimming up to safer waters, if you catch my drift. I myself am planning on leaving soon, my daughter is coming to pick me up in a couple of days, but I can't just sit idly and wait. Plus, this shop holds so much meaning to me, I can't help but to stay with it as long as I can."

That explains the ghost town. You take a peek outside. Nary a soul to be seen, still.

*comment merchant looking for escort
Just as you're about to hop into your car and head straight to ${location_choice_name}, you hear a voice shouting in your general direction. Turning around, you see a round, pudgy man running towards you, or rather, attempting to. Upon reaching a few meters from where you stand, he leans forward and try to catch his breath, palms resting on his knees.
*line_break
*line_break
"Hey… [i]huff[/i] are you by… [i]huff[/i]… by any chance, going [i]cough cough[/i] to ${location_choice_name}?" The rotund man sputters. Man, he is really out of shape.
*line_break
*line_break
"And what if I am?" You mutter coolly. You can't see how this has anything to do with this man here.
*line_break
*line_break
The man regains his usual posture. Standing up straight, you notice that there there is a certain air to how the man carries himself, an image of confidence, though his voice suggests a cheerful personality. "I'm a traveling merchant, looking to buy and sell my wares across different cities and towns." As he says that, he gestures behind him with a showy flourish of his right arm, and you notice crates of goods stacked against each other.
*line_break
*line_break
"However, there has been a slight issue with my usual transportation, and as of now I am unable to ferry my goods. As I've overheard, you seem to be headed to ${location_choice_name}, which just so happens to be where my next intended destination is as well. If you would be so kind, do you mind helping out a poor merchant? I guarantee that I'll find some way to repay your goodwill should you choose to help me."
*line_break
*line_break
Hmm… You mull over his words for a moment. On one hand, the merchant promised a reward, but agreeing to help him definitely will take up a bit of your time, as you'll need to help him load and unload his wares. Moreover, you might even need to drop him off at some other part of ${location_choice_name}.
*fake_choice
	#Offer your aid
		Eh, what do you have to lose? You're both heading towards the same destination anyway. Might as well help out a man in need.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Alright. Load up your stuff on the back, but hurry up. I can't afford to dawdle here any more." You stride towards the pile, knowing that if you let the man do all the work the hours will just drag on before he's even halfway done.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Immediately, the merchant's face lights up. "Oh thank you so much, kind sir! Really, I can't express my thanks enough!" The jolly voice follows behind you as the merchant trudges frantically to catch up with you.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		With your help, the both of you load up all the merchant's goods onto your vehicle in a jiffy. Soon, you're out on the road, the merchant happily jabbering away in the passenger seat. Strangely, his company makes the road a little less lonely as he shares with you various anecdotes and advice. Before long, you've arrived at ${location_choice_name}.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Dropping the merchant off, you help him unload his wares and bid him farewell. Before you return to your vehicle, however, the merchant grabs you by your wrist.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Hey, I really owe you big time. I've got to repay you somehow, but I can't just give you some of my goods. I have a business to run, after all. However, I can give you a huge discount, almost at cost price, for whatever catches your eye. What say you?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Wow, that's certainly generous of him. Well, no reason not to take him up on his offer.
		*comment can code in various goods at super low price here, not sure if we should have a fixed list of goods or rotating/random.
	#Leave him, you don't have time for this.
		"I'm really sorry, I'm in a hurry." You walk back to your vehicle steadfastly, the cries of protest from the man falling on deaf ears.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Jumping into your vehicle, you take one last glance at the man, who has fallen to his knees, a dejected figure kneeling on the ground. You fixate your eyes on the road in front of your windscreen and drive away towards ${location_choice_name}.
