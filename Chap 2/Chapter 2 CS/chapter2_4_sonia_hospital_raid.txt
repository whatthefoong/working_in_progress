Another 5 days pass. You are mostly recovered now, able to walk on your own two feet without a crutch. Sergeant ${sergeant} and the rest of your men back at the barracks were merciful enough to send some civilian clothes to the hospital for you and the other injured soldiers, so you wouldn't have to continue wearing those baby blue hospital gowns. 
*line_break
*line_break
Curiously, no army personnel have come to pay you a visit. Not that you feel neglected, but you do wonder what the situation is like back at base.  
*line_break
*line_break
It is 10pm at night. You sit patiently on your bed as Doctor ${doctor} does a final check-up on your body. She apologizes for having this check-up at such a late hour; Torian patients are always given preferential treatment. 
*line_break
*line_break
After a final beep from a blood pressure monitor, ${doctor} tears the velcro off the sleeve around your bicep, loosening it and sliding it off your arm. She scribbles something quick on her clipboard -  as usual. 
*line_break
*line_break
"Well Commander, you've made a full recovery, and in a surprisingly short amount of time too given the state in which you were brought in." ${doctor} says, tapping her chin with the end of her pen.
*line_break
*line_break
"So, what's the plan?" she inquires, placing the clipboard aside. She stretches, loosening up and switching from her serious work mode to her more personable side. "The hospital can't let you stay in this ward anymore if you're fully recovered, we have many other patients waiting. You thinking of returning to base?"
*line_break
*line_break
You scratch the back of your head. "No… I'm going to wait for the rest of my soldiers to recover. Leave no man behind, all that. Then we'll probably head back as a group." You recall having been informed that your injured allies needing another 3 or 4 days before they can be discharged.
*line_break
*line_break
"But do you have a place to stay until then?"
*line_break
*line_break
Shoot, you hadn't thought that far ahead. "I suppose I'll have to check into a motel or something." you reply, slightly deflated at the thought of forking out your own money. ${doctor} nods quietly.
*line_break
*line_break
Suddenly she perks up. "Do you want to get a drink?" 
*line_break
*line_break
You take a second to register what she said. From observing the hardworking woman with incredible work ethic for the last 2 weeks, you somehow never thought about what she did off-hours.
*line_break
*line_break
She sees the incredulous expression on your face, and deadpans, "You don't have to be that surprised. I'm not a robot. I still need to take a breather once in a while." 
*line_break
*line_break
She rises from her seat, and begins walking out of the ward, gesturing for you to follow, which you do.
*page_break
As the two of you descend down the elevator, your mind runs rampant with thoughts. What kind of place is she bringing me, you ponder. A night club? No, that doesn't seem to be her thing. Maybe some hipster corner bar with complicated foreign names for drinks. That sounds about right. Or maybe-
*line_break
*line_break
The doors open to… the 10th floor? You figured you would have gone all the way down to the lobby, maybe hit the streets.
*line_break
*line_break
You wordlessly follow ${doctor} as she navigates the network of hallways. From the past few days of exploring you are rather confident in navigating the interior of the hospital, but you can't read ${doctor}'s intentions on bringing you here.
*line_break
*line_break
Finally, the two of you arrive in front of a door simply labeled [i]Staff Lounge[/i]. You raise an eyebrow, but ${doctor} ignores you, pushing open the door.
*line_break
*line_break
Whatever expectations you had are blown away. The lounge is large, possibly the size of three wards stacked together, with maple wood walls not seen in any other part of the hospital. In one corner there's a pristine white pantry with a wide assortment of snack and candy dispensers awaiting you, and to the side of it is a bar counter with several bottles of drinks and glasses hanging on a rack. On the other end of the room there's 2 loveseat sofas upholstered in exquisite red velvet, one facing the pantry, the other facing a wide-screen wall-mounted television screen, currently playing a basketball match. In between that there are several wooden chairs and tables of incredible craftsmanship for dining or other work. In a corner of the room there's even an additional grey pull out couch that is currently in its bed form. There's a piece of modern art hung on the back wall; a large white canvas with splatters of red gold and black paint across. Overhead there are [i]chandeliers[/i] lighting up the room.
*line_break
*line_break
Overall: slightly gaudy for your tastes, but still breathtaking as far as staff lounges go.
*line_break
*line_break
You and ${doctor} are not alone in the room. You spy a male doctor relaxing on the couch, watching the game on the television. He turns to the two of you as you enter. He has dark brown hair - not dissimilar to ${doctor}'s, combed back in a loose pompadour with the sides shaved. He has sharp features, a chiseled chin. He waves lazily at ${doctor} before returning his attention to the TV.
*line_break
*line_break
Doctor ${doctor} removes her doctor's coat and hangs it on a coat rack. She wears a simple white fitting t-shirt and black jorts underneath. Seeing her for the first time without her coat, you notice her arms and legs are slightly paler than her face and hands. You also can't help but notice her slender figure; curvy, but not provocatively so. There is an aura of poise and elegance about her that enraptures you, almost like a ballerina.
*line_break
*line_break
She leads you by the hand over to the bar counter. She places two whiskey glasses onto the counter, then pulls a brown bottle off the rack.
*line_break
*line_break
"Scotch, on the rocks?" she asks. You nod, just glad to have [i]any[/i] form of alcohol after 2 weeks of abstaining. She reaches under the bar, opening a freezer and placing an ice ball into each glass. She then uncaps the bottle, pouring the golden liquid over the ice, letting it cascade down into the glass.
*line_break
*line_break
Sliding a glass to you, she raises hers towards you. "To your speedy recovery." she toasts with a pleasant smile. You return the smile, clinking your glass against hers before taking a sip.
*line_break
*line_break
You place your lips on the cool glass, tipping the contents. The cool liquid makes your mouth tingle as it trickles down your throat, leaving a warm burning sensation across your tongue. As you swallow, you can't help but let out a sigh of satisfaction. That really hit the spot.
*line_break
*line_break
${doctor} laughs quietly. "Say what you will about Torians, but there are definitely perks for working with them." She says jokingly, while she gestures at the expensive furnishings around the room with her glass, watching the liquid sway giddily in its transparent container.
*line_break
*line_break
She sets the glass down. "Sometimes doctors spend the night here. I suppose if you need to, you can stay here until your men are discharged. I'll tell the other doctors to leave you be."
*line_break
*line_break
You thank her profusely for the free lodging. "Just promise to treat me to a nice dinner sometime" she replies mirthfully, taking another sip of whiskey.
*line_break
*line_break
There's silence between the two of you now. ${doctor} gently plays with her drink, klinking the ice ball against the glass. The sound of cheering and commentating from the television isn't obnoxiously loud, but present.
*line_break
*line_break
You decide to start a conversation…

	*disable_reuse #Ask about ${doctor}'s family.
		*set relationship_sonia %+5
		*set conversations_with_sonia +1
		"So… do you have any siblings?" you ask lamely, breaking the pause in conversation. ${doctor} looks up at you with a smile.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Yes I do. I have two younger brothers - ones 12, the other is 8. They're back in my home country. I send money back for them to continue schooling."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"My family lives on a farm, you see. It was a relaxed lifestyle, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. We sell potatoes and peaches and other produce. I do miss it sometimes…"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		She trails off, as if reminiscing of treasured memories. She snaps out of it for a moment. "I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to prattle on about my history."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You wave your hands to dismiss her inhibitions. "No, I'm actually rather curious about your life. After all, you already know mine."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		She sighs, before taking another sip. "Alright, just cut me off if you get tired of my rambling."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I love my parents, they are very sweet and raised me and my brothers well. They used their savings to put me through school, and even when I said I wanted to go to medical school they never said no. They borrowed money from extended family members to help me get through, never once telling me that I should stop or return to the farm. I owe them a ton."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"My brothers are a lot younger than me, sometimes I worry that I used up too much of my parents savings, so I try to send as much money back as I can. Just paying it forward, you know?" 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I accepted this job and moved over here 3 years ago. When news of war broke out, you can imagine that my parents got concerned. For the first time they called me back, told me to come home. I understand that they were worried about me, but I saw so many patients needing my help… I couldn't leave them alone. I refused my parents, and stayed here to help the war victims."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I still keep in touch with them through mail, and I continue to send them part of my earnings. Its just… oh, I'm a lousy daughter.." she laughs sadly, taking yet another swig, emptying her glass.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You frown. "No you're not. You love them enough to send them letters and money, how does that make you lousy? I'm sure your parents must be proud of you."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		She looks into your eyes as you reassure her. Those emerald eyes reflect such depth, you feel like you could drown in them. She nods gently, but doesn't reply. She begins pouring herself another glass, and then refills yours.

		"So… how'd you decide you wanted to be a doctor?" you ask, making conversation. ${doctor} looks at you with interest.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Oh that… there's a funny story for that actually." she closes her eyes, as if to reenter the memory. Her smile widens gradually.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I think I was in 5th grade, when I fell over and gave myself a nasty cut. It was bleeding pretty badly, and the friend I was walking with ran off to get a teacher. 10 year old me saw some leafy plants nearby, and remembered reading that certain herbs could heal wounds. So I grabbed a bunch and tried to staunch the bleeding."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		A smile forms on your lips, sensing where this story was going. "Did it work?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Nope. It was poison ivy."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Both of you burst into laughter simultaneously. In between laughs, she squeaks out "The wound got so infected, I had to go to the hospital for, like, 3 days."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"But it was there that I think I found out I wanted to be a doctor. The doctors treated me very well, spent time making me feel better, told me stories, complimented my, uh, [i]enthusiasm[/i]. I wanted to be like them, helping the sick and injured."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You nod approvingly, taking a sip of beverage. "That's a really good story actually. Its honestly rare to find you humanitarian types nowadays."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		She nods, accepting the compliment quietly. The atmosphere calms, and she continues "Well, I'm not sure if I like the term 'humanitarian'. I don't know, I guess I just like helping people. Maybe that says something about me, like I'm just…. a sucker for a good sob story." She laughs sadly to herself, taking one more swig of scotch, emptying the glass.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You shake your head at the self-criticism. "I assure you, everyone here is very appreciative of what you do. You're the only doctor even trying to fight the Torian bias." you encourage.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		She looks back at you, those deep emerald irises peering into you, like they could just swallow you whole. She sighs, choosing not to add to that, and begins to pour herself a new glass, as well as refilling yours.

		*set conversations_with_sonia +1
		"…so how did things go with Anastasia and her parents?" the words came out naturally, before you could even think of stopping yourself. You had been so eager to know about that whole situation that you hadn't considered ${doctor}'s feelings. 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		${doctor}'s expression turns somber. "Ah yes, Anastasia…" she mutters quietly, looking down at her own reflection in her glass.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I met with her parents a few days ago… but I chose not to tell them about the situation with the Torian patient taking the medicine. I just told them that, despite our best efforts, Anastasia's outbreak was too severe to treat."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You jerk upon hearing this. Lying to the parents about the cause of death… is that okay?
		*line_break
		*line_break
		${doctor} tries to justify herself. "I know, I know its a pretty scummy move. Trust me, I've been thinking about it since. But what would have been the alternative? 'Yeah, your daughter died because some rich fucks threw money at the bosses and practically stole the only available cure that could have saved her, so sorry.'?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Her voice is strained with exasperation and emotion, so fragile it might snap under the pressure. You begin to notice, as she looks at you with a pained expression, the red in her eyes from days of crying, and the loose strands of unkempt hair that stick to her shirt, fallen off from stress. 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Any thought of trying to accuse her of lying disappears. Who are [i]you[/i] to say what's right or wrong? You spent the last week lying in bed while she had to bear this burden of breaking the news, lying through her teeth to avoid any more grief and hatred from being spread. Whether what she did was right or wrong… you have your reservations, but you decide now is not the best time to chastise someone on ethics.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		${doctor} rests her head on the smooth bar counter. "Anastasia's parents… they were as sweet as their daughter. They thanked me - [i]thanked. me.[/i] For doing my best. They hugged me and comforted me, and said that Anastasia always spoke fondly of me, and would continue to watch me from above…"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		${doctor} lifts her head up and downs the rest of her glass. Letting out a sigh, ${doctor} stares at the ice ball in the glass for a long while, before refilling it with more whiskey.

		"So… do you have any thoughts on the war?" you ask, before groaning internally. Why do your topics always end up being about war? 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		${doctor} ponders for a moment. "Well I believe I've told you this already, but I don't really have much of an opinion. While many of the Torians here are assholes, I can't label them all as evil. Same goes for Morovians. Personally I think all this infighting is ridiculous, but that's just me I suppose." she says, sipping her drink. 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I apologize if that was offensive to you, I don't mean to belittle your cause," ${doctor} says, realizing she might have unintentionally come off as rude. "I just… don't believe there are any true winners in war. I'll treat anyone in need if I have the ability to do so. I don't discriminate when I'm saving lives."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You feel like bringing up your own opinions, but her apparent disinterest in the topic and the mood in the room holds you back. 
		*line_break

		You're unsure if its the whiskey talking but… ${doctor} looks like an angel right now.

		"Doc… you aren't attached to anyone at the moment right now, are you?" you casually suggest. She looks up to meet your gaze, but you resist the urge to retreat.

				*line_break

				${doctor} laughs as you fumble over your words. "Relax, I'm only teasing." she jokes. 
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You feel annoyed, as if you weren't being treated as an adult. However, the bubbling frustration fades when you notice the blush on her cheeks as she brings her glass up to her lips to take a sip. "But if you are… I'm very flattered."
			*line_break
			*line_break
			She looks away, towards a corner of the room, as if debating whether she should tell the truth or lie.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			After a brief pause, she chuckles, turning back to you. "In this line of work? Please, I don't have enough time for myself, let alone a significant other."
			*line_break
			*line_break
			"Well, we have some time right now, don't we?" you reply, your intentions clearly laid out in your tone. ${doctor}'s eyebrows raise fully, the playful smile still present, as if impressed by your confidence.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			"Fufufu… I suppose we do. What do you suggest we do then?" ${doctor} says, feigning ignorance. With a delicate index finger, she begins to trace the rim of her glass. You resist the urge to pounce on her.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			Tearing your eyes away from the alluring visage of the lovely brunette, you notice the male doctor getting up from the sofa, exiting the lounge. Perhaps he needed to go home, or perhaps he overheard the two of you and decided he wanted no part in what was about to happen. Regardless, you silently thank him for the gift of privacy.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			You rise from the bar, walking around the counter over to ${doctor}'s side. Her deep emerald eyes trace you as you move. "Perhaps showing would be easier than telling." you say, brushing a strand of her hair out of her face. Its subtle, but as your fingers brush past her skin, she shudders. 
			*line_break
			*line_break
			In a husky voice, barely a whisper, she says 				"Well then… [i]show me the way, Commander.[/i]"
			*line_break
			*line_break
			Given the green light, you extend you palm towards her, an invitation she accepts as she places her hand in yours. It feels small, delicate, almost fragile. Yet you know these hands are anything but unseasoned - these hands have saved countless lives. You wrap your fingers around hers, feeling the cold sensation of her skin in your palm.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			She gets up from her seat, and allow you to guide her towards the sofa-bed. As you fall into the plush, you feel your body sink into the cushion a good inch or two, hugging you.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			${doctor} collapses into the seat by your side, laughing lightly. You feel her body press up against you, her chest rubbing against your arm. Her white, cotton T-shirt leaves nothing to the imagination - the smooth texture of her bra against your skin sends chills through your body.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			The lady takes a moment to compose herself, but doesn't retreat. Still leaning on you, she turns to look into your eyes. You faces are so close, you can feel her breath on your skin - heavier with each passing second.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			Her face is flushed - a combination of the drinks and the mood. Her lips quiver in anticipation, just slightly parted. Her eyes, pools of verdant green, call to you, inviting you to dive in. Being this close, the aromatic scent of cinnamon and whiskey enters your nose; a heavenly combination. 
			*line_break
			*line_break
			Presented with such a sight, you can't help but mutter, "Doc-"
			*line_break
			*line_break
			Much to your surprise, ${doctor} makes the first move. In one swift movement she closes the distance between the two of you, pressing her lips against yours. They are as soft as pillows. At first, she merely makes innocent, light contact, but then she dives deeper, increasing the pressure. For a moment, her tongue brushes over your lower lips, getting a quick taste.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			After what feels like an eternity, she releases you from her spell, pulling away. Still in shock, you find yourself at a lost for words. A seductive smile lingering on her lips, cocky from taking you by surprise, she utters, "We're off hours now, ${name}. Call me ${doctor}."
			*line_break
			*line_break
			Unable to hold back any longer, you dive towards the brunette, pushing her against the arm of the sofa. She giggles at your eagerness, but you shut her up by closing her lips with your own. A moan escapes her as you push your tongue into her mouth, intertwining with hers. 
			*line_break
			*line_break
			As you break away from her once more, allowing both of you to catch your breaths, you correct yourself. "${doctor}…" your voice barely a whisper. She doesn't reply, but her eyes signal her approval, urging you to be bolder.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			You slide your arm under her shirt. Her eyes widen, taken by surprise as she bites her lower lip to keep her voice down. You feel her whole body shiver in ecstasy from your fingers crawling up her smooth belly, making their way further up. 
			*line_break
			*line_break
			She looks deep into your eyes, leaning into you. She places her forehead against yours, and whispers "I'm glad I met you…" With that, you two kiss once more, a prelude to an [i]eventful[/i] night.

			She remains silent for a little while, sipping her drink. A little too-long-than-a-little while.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			She finally puts down her glass with a sigh. "No, I'm not. But I'm not interested in having a relationship anytime soon."
			*line_break
			*line_break
			"Oh…" Perhaps its the alcohol influencing you, but you're unable to guise the disappointment in your voice. 
			*line_break
			*line_break
			${doctor} smiles sympathetically. "Sorry, Commander. You're wonderful, and my time with you has been very enjoyable, but I've dedicated myself to my work. I don't have time for a relationship right now."
			*line_break
			*line_break
			You smile and nod, appreciating her attempts at comforting you. While her bluntness stings, you appreciate her honesty as opposed to coming up with vague excuses.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			${doctor} looks away, taking another swig from her glass. There's a palpable awkwardness in the air. Shit.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			Finishing off her glass, she sets it down on the counter, then gets off her seat. 
			*line_break
			*line_break
			"If you don't mind, Commander, I'm going to make a move first. I really need to be getting more sleep, jeez…" she yawns, stretching her back.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			You wave at each other, before she begins walking towards the door. You pretend to watch the game being played on the television, but through your peripherals you fixate on the doctor as she dons her white coat, until she finally opens the door and leaves.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			Shoot, that could have gone better, you think to yourself as you take a big swig of whiskey. Well, on the bright side, she let you down gently. Plus, she didn't reject you because of [i]you[/i], but because of work! Yeah… the window's still there. Maybe in the future, when this war is over and she's more available. Yeah…
			*line_break

	#Flirt with the male doctor at the couch.
		For some reason, your eyes can't seem to focus on the doctor in front of you. Instead, they wander over to the stud on the couch.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		From your angle you get a better view of his features. His body is muscular, with well developed shoulders and chest muscles - a stark contrast to ${doctor}'s slender build. He has a sandy skin tone, giving off the impression of an ex-surfer whose tan has lightened from being cooped up in a hospital for too long. A dark blue tight-fitting shirt wraps around his torso, emphasizing his biceps, as well as a pair of blacks slacks you [i]know[/i] are hiding something special.
		*line_break

		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Yup, totally." you lie to her face.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Well you must be hearing things because I didn't say anything." she triumphantly takes a swig of whiskey, having successfully trapped you. You turn away, willing the blush that's creeping up your face to stop.  
		*line_break
		*line_break
		She chuckles at your discomfort. "You can be honest with me. You think he's handsome?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You consider lying, but having been exposed you decide to keep it real. "Yeah. I mean, just look at him! Don't you think so?" you say in a volume just low enough that the man across the room wouldn't hear.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		${doctor} takes a moment to think, looking towards the top left. "Well… I guess? Maybe its because he was my student that I'm not particularly impressed. I have a rule against dating coworkers, and even then he's not really my type."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		If having the body of Adonis isn't ${doctor}'s type, she's probably going to be single for a loooong time, you think to yourself.

				${doctor} gestures towards you. "Mikey, this is Commander ${name}. Commander, this is Doctor Michael."
				*line_break

				There's a glint in his eye of sudden interest upon hearing the title of 'commander'. "Ah, good evening Commander. You can call me Mikey." he greets in a deep bassy voice.

				Now being the only two people in the room, your attention is undivided. 
				*line_break

				"Sorry about interrupting your game." you apologize, but he waves your concern away. "Nah, it was pretty much over at that point, don't worry about it."
				*line_break
				*line_break
				He takes a seat where Sonia had been. As he begins pouring a new glass for himself, he asks, "So anyways, tell me about yourself. Doctor ${doctor} isn't usually the type to socialize, so you must be pretty special if you're her 'friend'."
				*line_break
				*line_break
				He winks, but you try to remain as nonchalant as possible. "Well, maybe you'll find out tonight…" you reply.

				*line_break

				You try to apologize, but ${doctor} cuts you off with a smile. "Hey, don't worry about it. Thanks for the drinks and company, I'm just going to try and get a little more sleep."
				*line_break
				*line_break
				She waves goodbye and leaves you to continue admiring the hunk. You're unsure how much time passed before the male doctor finally turned off the television and got off the couch, at which you promptly averted your gaze towards your glass until you were sure he left the room.

	Mikey… That's right. You jolt upright, looking around. You remember spending the night with him, yet he's nowhere to be seen now. 
	*line_break

	"I think he might've ditched me a while ago." you say, somewhat discouraged that he left without a word.
	*line_break
	*line_break
	You hear ${doctor} click her tongue over the phone. "I was worried this would happen. He's a fun guy, but he's not one for serious relationships. Sorry, I should have warned you. I'll make sure to give him a good scolding later."
	*line_break
	*line_break
	You chuckle lightly as ${doctor} automatically takes on a motherly role. "Don't worry, I'm fine. I can take care of myself."

*line_break
Your eyelids feel like they're glued together. You head is throbbing. What happened last night?
*line_break
*line_break
You and ${doctor} went out for drinks, talked for a little while, and then… and then…
*line_break
*line_break
[i]Oh, right.[/i]
*line_break
*line_break
Your eyes snap open. The room is dark but your make out the silhouette of ${doctor}'s slender figure, standing off to the side, putting on her bra. She turns to acknowledge you. "Morning, sleeping beauty. I didn't mean to wake you up."
*line_break
*line_break
You wrap your arms around her thighs, attempting to pull her back into the sheets for another round, but she pushes you away. 
*line_break
*line_break
"Sorry ${name}, the other doctors should be coming in soon, I've got to get ready." she says in a monotone, pulling her shorts up. 
*line_break
*line_break
"Ugh, these clothes probably reek of alcohol… I wonder if I have enough time to get a change of clothes." she thinks aloud to herself.
*line_break
*line_break
Your pride is hurt, having been pushed away like that. Fuck, you really thought you hit it off with the doc last night. Was this all just a casual fling to her?
*line_break
*line_break
"Hey, ${name}."
*line_break
*line_break
You look up to look at ${doctor} as she gently cups your face in her hand and plants a kiss on your cheek.
*line_break
*line_break
Pulling away slightly, she whispers "Listen… I just wanted to say thank you for last night. It really was magical, and I really needed it. I don't know if this means we're… [b]together[/b]-together, but… give me some time to think about it alright?"
*line_break
*line_break
You don't need to see her to know that she's blushing deeply. Before you get a chance to reply, she kisses you passionately on the lips, stealing your words.
*line_break
*line_break
After a solid 5 seconds she finally lets you go, promptly slipping her T-shirt over herself. You watch wordless as she walks towards the coat rack to grab her coat.
*line_break
*line_break
"Oh, one more thing," she adds. "People usually come in here for breakfast around 7, so if you could do me a favor and clean up this place up before then, that'd be great."
*line_break
*line_break
With those parting words, ${doctor} blows a kiss towards you, then leaves.

Only now does it occur to you that you're still in your birthday suit, and you have - looking at the clock - 10 minutes to get ready.

*line_break
*line_break
You're relaxing in the lounge, watching some drama series you have zero investment in. Dressed in a simple gray hoodie and blue jeans, a set of clothes ${doctor} was gracious enough to produce for you so you wouldn't have to run around reeking of booze and bad decisions, you sink into the cushions. 
*line_break
*line_break
Oh how far you've fallen. Just 2 weeks ago you were in the heat of the battlefield, fighting for your life, protecting the soil you stand on. 
*line_break
*line_break
And here you are, watching a 2-episode special of [i]Sultry Housewives[/i] with a heaping bowl of dry cereal in your lap. 
*line_break
*line_break
You had checked in on the rest of your men earlier today. They were recovering steadily: all able to walk without assistance. The doctors want to keep them for one more day to run some final tests before they get properly discharged.
*line_break
*line_break
You spent an hour or two chatting with them, but after a while it became apparent that you aren't as chummy with them as you think you are. There's an air of awkwardness between you and them, as if they weren't able to speak their minds with you around. That's pretty fair, you think. There should be a level of respect between a manager and their staff. But regardless, after lunch you made to decision to have some time away from them, opting to use your access to the lounge to its fullest.
*line_break
*line_break
You haven't had many opportunities to speak with ${doctor} since that night. No longer being her patient, you only got to see her once or twice briskly walking down the hallways, exchanging a 'hi' and 'hello' before she was off once more. 
*line_break
*line_break
You're leaving tomorrow, returning to the military lifestyle. Who knows when you'll be back here, if ever. Perhaps you should arrange for that dinner you promised ${doctor}.

A new message from an unknown number.
*line_break

[i]Hello Commander ${name}. How has your morning been?[/i]
*line_break
[i]Was wondering if you could do us a favor. Rest assured, you will be paid handsomely for it.[/i]
*line_break
[i]You are good friends with Doctor ${doctor} yes? Then you should be able to access some of her documents.[/i]
*line_break
[i]I need you to find the patient list, the list of names of every patient in the hospital right now.[/i]

[i]Once you find it, let me know. I will give you more instructions.
*line_break
[i]Can you do this by today? I promise it will be worth your while.[/i]
*line_break
*line_break
You take the bowl of snacks off your lap, placing them onto the coffee table. You squint at your phone, re-reading the text over and over again.
*line_break
*line_break
Surely this must be some kind of joke, right? 
*line_break
*line_break

Another text, from the same number.
*line_break

[i]You must be so bored, lying in the staff lounge watching TV. A soldier like you must be itching for some excitement, yes? Just one snap of your camera, and $1000 is yours. [/i]
*line_break
*line_break
You immediately whirl around, surveying every corner of the lounge. There are a few doctors in here with you. 2 female doctors talking by the bar, a male nurse making coffee at the pantry, and a male doctor slurping a take-out box of noodles. None of them are using their phones.
*line_break
*line_break
You turn your attention back to your phone again, trepidation growing within yourself. How does this person know your name, your friends, and [i]your exact location?[/i]
*line_break
*line_break
You feel your palms begin to clam up. Your danger sense is on full alert. The calm atmosphere in the room has turned a full 180. Anyone and everyone is a potential spy.

		*line_break
		*line_break
		Peeling yourself off the couch, you exit the lounge, phone still in hand. This better not be some sick prank, you think to yourself, a mixture of annoyance, worry and hopefulness bubbling in you.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Knowing the layout of the hospital like the back of your hand at this point, you make your way over to the records room.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Standing in front of the door, you cautiously turn the handle - to find it unlocked. As you gently push the door open, you find the room vacant. You heave a sigh of relief and close the door behind you, glad that this operation is going as smoothly as it is.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The room is tidy - almost untouched. The walls are a sterile white, just like the rest of the wards. There are 2 stations of computers on desks, with printers wired up next to them. Two oak wood cabinets line the opposite end of the room.Finally there is a window, curtains currently tied up neatly by the sides, that allows some natural light in.

		*line_break

		Perhaps there is some way of having your cake and eating it. The thought of faking the list enters your mind. Would that work? Being able to claim the $1000 without endangering the safety of others…

		*line_break
		The idea seems more and more enticing as you ruminate over it. You reply the sender: "Alright, I'll do it."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You leave the lounge, making your way towards the records room that you've come across several times in your past 2 weeks of exploring, but never actually entered.

		*line_break
		*line_break
		[i]Where are you going? Are you agreeing?[/i]
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You resist the urge to reply, continuing your brisk pace moving as far away from the lounge as possible. Your mind is running at a million miles an hour, trying to come up with a solution. Who is this, and why have they targeted you? Is there anyone who could help with this? The police?
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Vibrations erupt from your pockets once more, just as you enter an empty elevator. Upon reading the new text, your blood turns cold.
		*line_break

		*line_break
		After that, you don't receive further messages from the unknown sender. The uneasiness hangs in the air, as you're uncertain who to turn to. The number is unrecognizable, you imagine the contact is reaching out to you through some 'disposable' number, which provides little leads to follow even if you had the police look into it. Even if you wanted to ask for help, would anybody be able to get to the bottom of it?
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Seeing as you are leaving this damned hospital tomorrow morning, you decide to try and shrug the matter off. and just carry on with your day as though you had seen nothing. But threat of some invisible threat who seems to know so much about you continue to gnaw at the back of your mind.

		Having gained access to the computer, you open up a new text file. Pulling up a few official documents from some of the folders on the desktop as reference material, you begin fabricating a fake patient list.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You find a list of random names online which you copy over, and slap your hands over the keyboard to create some ID numbers. You key in random numbers for the wards, and randomly key in some fake ward numbers - being sure to remain within the realm of what seems realistic.

		After a good 10 minutes, you finish your masterpiece. Unless you really scrutinized it, it could certainly fool someone into thinking it to be the real deal. Satisfied, you hit the print button.

		The old machine whirs to life, causing a huge ruckus in the process as internal pieces click and chunk and thunk into place. You keep an eye on the door, worried that at any moment someone would barge in, but thankfully, after a solid 5 minutes of waiting in fear, your list is churned out of the device without interruption.

Just as you're about to congratulate yourself on a job well done, you hear the sound of footsteps approach the door. 
*line_break
*line_break
In a hurry, you fold the list you just procured and shove it in your back pocket and clean up any evidence of your tampering, just as you hear the door handle turn.
*line_break
*line_break
You try to stand as nonchalantly as you can, leaning against the desk, looking out the window. 
*line_break
*line_break
Through your peripherals, you see a old lady, with curly brown hair, dressed in the pine green cleaning staff uniform. She clutches a mop in her left hand and a bucket in her right. 
*line_break
*line_break
"Excuse me," she croaks in a deep voice.
*line_break
*line_break
You turn to face her, as if having just noticed her arrival.
*line_break
*line_break
"I'm going to mop this room now, so I'm going to need you to leave for a while."
*line_break
*line_break
Her face is covered in wrinkles, making the lady have a permanent expression of annoyance. You decide not to test whether she truly is annoyed or not, and obey her instructions.
*line_break

You exit the room quickly, pulling out your phone to update the unknown sender of your progress.

You begin typing into the keypad.

	You lean against the wall outside, waiting patiently. You pay close attention to the halls, watching the occasional patient or doctor walk past. No one enters or exits the washroom.

	But… nobody went in and nobody left. Nobody was in the washroom - you're sure of that. So how-
	*line_break
	*line_break
	Perplexed, you hurriedly return to the washroom and - lo and behold, and stack of ten 100 dollar bills sit where you had left the list.
	*line_break
	*line_break
	You spin around, searching for any sign of life, any way for someone to have avoided your vigilant watch and snuck in here, but find no leads. Utterly perplexed, you decide not to question the methods of this mysterious sender, and simply be satisfied with the payout. You pocket the bills and return to the staff lounge.

The last of the light from the sun is snuffed out, as the orange ball of light descends past the horizon line of the city scape, painting the skies a gradient of oranges, reds and magentas, before eventually being swallowed up in midnight blue. Though the sun has set, the city of Giralmore continues to thrive. Streetlights illuminate the roads where cars, motorcycles and trucks speed up and down. Windows in the multitude of towering buildings remain lit, with workers pressing on to complete their last hour of work before calling it a day. Humanity defies Mother Nature's decree of the day being over, as life continues despite the moon now rising high into the sky, looking down on the world below.
*line_break
*line_break
You lean against the window, alone in the lounge, peering out into the nightlife. A glass of gin and tonic in your hand, an attempt at calming your nerves from your little [i]encounter[/i] earlier this day. You stare out into the night, sipping your beverage absent-minded, letting the thoughts flow uninhibited.
*line_break
*line_break
You had tried to reach out to ${doctor} but was unable to find her. Asking around, you found out that she had left work early today to pursue some personal matters. Alas, it seems you'll have to treat her to the promised dinner the next time you're in town.
*line_break
*line_break
Your thoughts return to the mysterious messages you received. They still remain in your phone, though there has been no follow up since. Who could it have been? Doctor Karll? You hadn't heard much about the shrewd doctor, though the mannerisms from the text don't match. Was this the LOM trying to reach out to you? 
*line_break
*line_break
You sigh, shaking your head. No use over-thinking about it now. In a couple of hours, you and the rest of the soldiers will be out of here, on a truck heading for the camp along the outskirts of the city. There, you'll likely resume your soldier life. What other battles await you?
*line_break
*line_break
"Whatever comes next, I'm ready for it." you mutter to yourself, finishing off the last bit of your drink, steeling yourself.
*line_break
*line_break
As if the universe itself wished to spite you, the sound of gunfire echoes reaches your ears. Your body tenses.
*line_break
*line_break
From outside the hospital, you hear screams, the barking of commands in the Morovian dialect, and more gunfire. You try look down to get a better view, but you're unable to make out what is happening from your angle.
*line_break
*line_break
Are we being raided? Why now? Who's responsible? The LOM? What would they gain from raiding a hospital? 
*line_break
*line_break
The image of the wealthy Torians, laughing heartily, enjoying their riches, all gathered under a single roof enters your mind. [i]Oh.[/i]
*line_break
*line_break
You slap your cheeks, getting yourself together. Now's not the time for thinking, its time for action.
*line_break
*line_break
You exit the lounge, and as you do, a swarm of people in coats and hospital gowns bolt past you. Doctors, nurses and patients well enough to move are fleeing towards the stairs.
*line_break
*line_break
What do you do?
*fake_choice
	#Join the crowd and run for the stairs!

		*line_break
		*line_break
		*goto 2_4_10_stair_fight
	#Go by yourself towards the lift.
		You let the crowd run past you, too overwhelmed by fear to even notice your presence. When the coast is clear, you begin jogging in the opposite direction, towards the lift.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Sure, everyone knows the lift is a bad idea in such situations: a route with only one exit is easily blocked off. But that's what makes it so unexpected. You decide to take the gamble and head for the lift lobby.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You press the button for the lift and wait. It almost feels comical, the entire building in a frenzy while you're waiting with your hands in your pockets.
		*line_break
		*line_break

		*line_break
		*line_break
		The lift arrives at your floor. The metal doors part to reveal 4 armed soldiers, young men maybe 16-19, wearing simple makeshift armors. 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		For a second, you stare at them, and they stare back at you.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Well, so much for that gamble.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The soldiers point their rifles at you, ordering for you to get on the ground, with your hands in the air. Armed with just an empty whiskey glass you had forgotten about, you do as you're told.

		*line_break

		Being surrounded by civilians and having to worry about their well-being will only slow you down. You silently hope they'll be able to take care of themselves as you prioritize getting yourself out of here and better armed to be of more help.

			You stand just behind the door frame, readying yourself to pounce on anyone who comes through. You realize the whiskey glass from earlier still remains in your hand. It could serve as an effective weapon, you think to yourself.
			*line_break

			The sound of footsteps from the stairwell grow louder and louder, closer and closer. You raise the whiskey glass above your head, ready to bring it down on the first motherfucker who dares stick his head through this door.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			The footsteps have reached your floor, you're certain of it.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			The door yanks open, and a man - no, a teenage boy, maybe 16 or 17, comes through the doorway. Dark skin, a black buzzcut, wearing a bright orange T-shirt with an olive combat vest strapped over. Time seems to slow down as he turns notices you by the doorway, his eyes bugging out.
			*if physical > 20
				You don't hesitate as you bring your arm down with all your might, slamming the glass against the boy's temple. The glass shatters into a million pieces, with the sheer impact alone knocking the soldier out.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				Adrenaline supercharging you like electricity, you side step into the door frame, holding up the soldier you just knocked unconscious. You see 3 more boys, similarly dressed in civilian clothes and whatever makeshift armor they could find, come grinding to a halt as the front runner is now out cold.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				Grabbing the rifle, still slung around the unconscious boy, you spray lead into the 3 aggressors before they can react.  In seconds, they drop to the floor dead. You somehow managed to pull out victorious, against all odds.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You unsling the weapon and armor from the unconscious soldier in your arms, equipping yourself with them. You then loot the 3 soldiers for whatever else they had that might be of use: a helmet, some extra ammo, and a knife.

				Now fully equipped for a proper fight, you continue making your way down the stairs.
				*goto 2_4_12_win

				*line_break
				*line_break
				The boy, rifle still in his hands, sprays bullets in this narrow corridor. You duck to avoid the fire, but in such an enclosed space, your left shoulder gets clipped by the ricochet. You grimace and grip your injured shoulder, slumped on the ground. 
				*line_break
				*line_break
				3 more soldiers enter the corridor, pointing their weapons at you, barking at you to stand down. They look only slightly older than the boy you hammered, dressed similarly in civilian clothes with whatever protective armor they could find strapped over.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				The boy you hit picks himself up, recovering from the shock. He drives his foot into your side, kicking you while screaming vulgarities. You curl up into a fetal position to protect yourself as best you can as you're now at the mercy of these 4 armed soldiers.
