Another mundane day. You lie in your pristine white hospital bed, in the same position as you were for the entire week. 
*line_break
*line_break
After regaining consciousness, the first thing you did was call back to HQ. You updated them on your situation during the fight (though Sergeant ${sergeant} seemed to have already given them that information) as well as the current status of your injured members. Higher-ups assured you that the situation at Orlotek is being handled, and assure you that you can rest easy, and report again when all soldiers have recovered and are ready to return to the barracks.
*line_break
*line_break
In your time here, you've tried to make small talk with your fellow patients, but they're usually sedated or too exhausted to talk. The staff don't entertain your attempts at casual conversation either. They come in, change your bandages, scribble things on a clipboard, then leave. How diligent.
*line_break
*line_break
The only person who has even tried conversing with you is ${doctor}. If only she were here, you think to yourself.
*line_break
*line_break
As if on cue, your train of thought is broken abruptly by a commotion just outside the ward.
*line_break
*line_break
"You can't be fucking serious!"
*line_break
*line_break
Its Doctor ${doctor}. Her voice is raised and laced with venom, uncharacteristic of what you know of her.
*line_break
*line_break
"We didn't have a choice, ${doctor}. You know how this place works." A monotone voice replies, unprovoked by Sonia.
*line_break
*line_break
"That doesn't make this okay! We could have saved her, if we had just-"
*line_break
*line_break
"Look, I don't like this just as much as you do, but there's nothing we can do now. Cool yourself off and get back to work."
*line_break
*line_break
You hear footsteps of what you presume is ${doctor}'s coworker grows softer away from the ward as they walk away from the conversation.
*line_break
*line_break
${doctor} enters the room, her face haggard, her hand resting on the door frame to support herself. Her eyes are glazed over, defeated. After a moment of staring at the ground she turns up, noticing your presence.
*line_break
*line_break
She smiles weakly. "Sorry you had to hear all that, ${name}.
*fake_choice
	#What happened?
		"So you were eavesdropping?" she asks coyly, cocking an eyebrow. 		She chuckles as you try to find an excuse. 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Relax, I'm only teasing. Hearing someone yelling across the hallway shouldn't be considered eavesdropping." she jokes as she walks towards you.
	#You look tired, are you alright?
		*set relationship_sonia %+5
		Her expression lightens. "What kind of doctor am I, letting the patient comfort me." she chides herself under her breath.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I'm fine, thank you for asking." she straightens her back, walking towards you. 
	#I can knock the daylights out of him if you want.
		*set relationship_sonia %-5
		*set violence +1
		She shakes her head. "Honestly commander, not everything needs to be settled with violence."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I appreciate you looking out for me, but he's my coworker, my friend. No need for punching." she smiles patiently as she begins walking towards you.
*line_break
*line_break
She leans against the wall, reaches into her inner pocket for a stick of cinnamon, bringing it close to her nose.
*line_break
*line_break
"One of my patients here is a kid. Her name is Anastasia, a Morovian girl, only 7 years old. She had the most beautiful black eyes and the rosiest cheeks, just the sweetest bundle of joy." ${doctor} explains, smiling at the image.
*line_break
*line_break
"She suffers from a specific lung disease. Its fatal if untreated, but luckily when she was brought in while we could still save her. She's been in our care for about 2 months now, and is… was, recovering. In less than a month she might even have been discharged, able to go back to living like a normal kid."
*line_break
*line_break
${doctor} pauses. "But then we got a new patient. A politician, middle-aged guy. Same disease, coincidentally. He was still in the mild stages of the disease. He could have lived healthily for another 6 months. But he demanded to be treated immediately. We only had so much of the medicine available here. I prescribed him some mild painkillers for his chest pain and told him to wait for the next shipment arriving in 2 months."
*line_break
*line_break
"Last night, Anastasia's condition escalated. When I went to look for the medication… it wasn't there. With no other choice, I put her on laughing gas to ease the pain." ${doctor}'s expression hardens. "The entire time she was smiling, smiling through the tears, smiling through the pain. She said… she trusted me to save her."
*line_break
*line_break
There's a long pause. 
*line_break
*line_break
"After 6 hours, Anastasia passed away this morning."
*page_break
"When my coworkers came in just now, I asked what happened to the medicine. Apparently, the new patient went straight to the board of hospital directors, asking to be treated by another doctor without my notice. The hospital directors agreed."
*line_break
*line_break
"Because of the way things are… because he was [i]Torian[/i]… we had to listen to him. We used the last of the medication. And because of that, she's dead."
*line_break
*line_break
From your perspective you can't see her face. Her eyes are obscured by her bangs which haven't been clipped up like usually are. But she's trembling.
*line_break
*line_break
The stick of spice in her hand suddenly snaps in her grip. Both of you watch the two halves hit the floor.
*line_break
*line_break
She laughs sadly at all of this. "Maybe I should trade these cinnamon sticks for blunts…"
*fake_choice
	#You did your best.
		She doesn't look at you. "If 'my best' is watching a 7-year old die, then 'my best' isn't good enough."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"		There's no use berating yourself like this. There was nothing more you could have done." you try to rationalize. "You stayed by her side the whole night, you did your best to ease her pain. You're a great doctor, Ms ${doctor}. I'm sure Anastasia thought the same."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		She sighs, massaging the bridge of her nose in an attempt to compose herself.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Yes… Listen, I'm… I'm sorry, I don't mean to be all pessimistic like this. Thanks for trying to cheer me up. I just… need time." 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You nod, able to understand some of the grief she must be going through.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I just wonder… if Anastasia had been born a Torian… would I still get to see her smile today? This Torian, Morovian divide… it has to end." 
		*page_break
	#Fuckin Torians...
		"Fuckin Torians…" you unconsciously mutter under your breath. You find yourself surprised by your own words. The MRPA is made up of mostly Torian supporters, and you hadn't thought to question them until now.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		There's a moment of silence between the two of you.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Yup, those are our bosses." ${doctor} mutters. "This whole hospital is funded by them too, so we don't really get a say in these decisions." 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I'm a foreigner. I came here because I wanted to save people. I don't care if you're Torian, Morovian, Hadan, whatever. I'll treat you if you're hurt. Because regardless of your birthplace, your life is precious."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		She bends down to pick up the broken cinnamon stick. "I understand its not so simple for you folks. But this unfairness… it just can't go on."
		*page_break
	#This is just the world we live in, unfortunately.
		"What can we do? We're tiny pieces on this giant game board of politics, we can't change the way things are." You laugh at the futility of it all. 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		${doctor} is silent. "Do you truly believe that?" 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The sudden resolve in her voice surprises you. "No that's not-" you stammer, trying to restate your intentions.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"No its fine, I'm not accusing you of anything." she reassures. "Its just that… maybe I'm just an optimist, but I think we can do better."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"This whole Torian vs Morovian situation is stupid to me. This divide has taken so many lives… why do we keep doing these things to ourselves?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Maybe I'm just some naive foreigner, but if you're my patient, I don't care if you're Morovian, Torian or Hadan, I'll still treat you. Because regardless of your birthplace, your life is precious." 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Her sense of purpose and ambition shakes you, and makes you ponder about your own life. What have you been fighting for?
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Sorry, I just blurted some things out. I think I just need to get some rest." ${doctor} says, rubbing her puffy tired eyes.
		*page_break
At the worst possible timing, there's a knock on the door. Sonia quickly makes herself presentable. She throws the broken cinnamon into the bin, rubs the tears in her eyes, and arranges her hair neatly before answering "Come in." 
*line_break
*line_break
The door swings wide open as a large man sporting a XL-sized black suit enters. He has a shiny bald head, which reflects the light directly into your eyes as he enters the ward, dazing you. He has a… rounded figure, and lumbers rather than walks. At his collar he displays a bright red bow-tie. What brings this cartoon-brought-to-life here, you think to yourself. 
*line_break
*line_break
"Ah Good Morning! You must be Doctor ${doctor}, its a pleasure to meet you." he cheerily greets the doctor, his voice as large as his person. ${doctor} has regained her composure, shaking his hand (which engulfs her's). "The pleasure is mine, Mr…"
*line_break
*line_break
"${mrpa_official} Maximov, at your service! Ah, but Mr ${mrpa_official} is fine, Mr Maximov would be my father!" He laughs heartily. Sonia back smiles politely.
*line_break
*line_break
""Well Mr ${mrpa_official}, what can I help you with today?" Sonia puts her hands into the pockets of her coat. Looking at the 2 of them side by side, it looks as though a corgi is talking up to an elephant. Its almost comical.
*line_break
*line_break
"I just had to come in person to thank the doctor who saved my good friend, [b]Mr Garcia[/b]."
*line_break
*line_break
At the mention of the name, for a split-second you watch ${doctor}'s composure drop. There is a sudden intensity in her eyes, the veins on the side of her head tensing. Mr ${mrpa_official} seems to not have noticed this, however, as he continues blabbering.
*line_break
*line_break
"He was in a terrible state, honestly. Every time I met him he would look so pale, and have these deep eye bags. He would just go on and on about having trouble sleeping, and having chest pains up to - get this, 3 times a day! Can you imagine that, just suddenly feeling pain in the middle of the night? That must have been horrid! I told him to go to the hospital, go see a doctor, and he just kept refusing and refusing until finally he decided to give it a try and - wouldn't you know, he had a [i]rare lung disease![/i] Thank goodness I pushed him to get some professional help, heaven knows what kind of state he would've been. I tell you doc, I have a knack of knowing these kinds of things - maybe [i]I[/i] should be a doctor! Hohohoho, kidding~"
*line_break
*line_break
Sonia smiles throughout the man's incessant prattle. She seems to want to interrupt him, tell him that it wasn't her that treated his friend, but is unable to find the right time to. The mention of this Mr Garcia's rare lung disease and Sonia's hints of discomfort allow you to put two and two together: Mr Garcia was the reason why there wasn't enough medication for Anastasia.

	#step in and confront ${mrpa_official}. Does he know that he indirectly killed a child?!			
		"Hey!"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The duo look at you as you interrupted their one-sided conversation abruptly. There is an intensity in your voice you hadn't expected.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		${doctor} picks up on the animosity in your voice. She looks at you with, cautioning you to remain calm.

				You take a deep breath to control yourself. This isn't the warfront, these are civilians, you remind yourself.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"I apologize for eavesdropping, but I heard the mention of a Mr Garcia and a rare lung disease? Might I ask, did the doctors say he needed to be treated immediately? Or did he demand to be."
				*line_break
				*line_break
				Mr ${mrpa_official} is taken aback by your roundabout accusation. "Wait a moment, who are you-"
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You raise both hands up to show you mean no harm. "I'm just Ms ${doctor} patient and friend. News travels quickly in this place, I just want to confirm a few things I've been hearing."
				*line_break
				*line_break
				${mrpa_official} looks at you quizzically, unsure as if whether he should be talking to this stranger. His blabbermouth wins out, however, and he answers you.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"W-well, erm… I'm afraid I don't know the specifics but I believe the doctors told him that his condition wasn't particularly dire. B-but I mean, I don't see the harm in getting treatment earlier, after all as the saying goes its best to 'nip it in the bud', wouldn't you agree-"
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You cut him off again. "What if there wasn't enough medicine? What if there was someone else who desperately needed the treatment more than your friend, and because he demanded the treatment like a child, the people who desperately need it are denied?"
				*line_break
				*line_break
				${mrpa_official} looks increasingly uncomfortable, though seemingly unsure of what exactly is the issue. "W-what in blazes are you balbbering about?"
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You tell him everything ${doctor} told you. You tell him about Anastasia, the sweet girl with the same disease. You tell of ${doctor}'s refusal to treat Mr Garcia, given his relatively stable condition to Anastasia. You tell him of the events of last night, and the ordeal both Anastasia and ${doctor} had to go through.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				Mr ${mrpa_official}'s expression changes from anger to shock. He looks at Doctor ${doctor	} to see if what you say is true, and she simply nods slightly, her expression unreadable. 
				*line_break
				*line_break
				When you finish, ${mrpa_official} looks distraught. "I… I must speak to Mr Garcia about this immediately." He darts out of the room, faster than you have ever thought possible for him.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You sigh, satisfied that the truth has been spoken. Sonia strides up to your side, quietly, her face obscured by shadow. 
				*line_break
				*line_break
				Maybe she's here to thank yo-
				*line_break
				*line_break
				She punches you in the gut, right where it hurts the most.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				Granted, it wasn't [i]that[/i] hard of a punch, but she nailed you in the sorest part of your body. You double over in pain.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				She looks down on you with no sympathy. "That's for revealing confidential information, asshat. I could've dealt with that myself."
				*line_break

				Watching you roll around in agony, her threatening facade breaks, and she giggles quietly to herself.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				She sighs, pulling out a fresh stick of cinnamon from her coat. "Still, I'm glad the truth is out. Thanks for sticking your neck out for me. I'm sure… I'm sure Anastasia will be able to rest easy now." 
				*line_break
				*line_break
				She smells the cinnamon for a moment, then kisses it gently, before putting it by your bedside. 
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"Well, I've wasted enough time here. Bye." She exits, with renewed energy. 
				*line_break
				*line_break

				"Did you know that a child died yesterday, because of your [i]dear Mr Garcia[/i]?" The animosity in your voice is very evident at the moment. 
				*line_break
				*line_break
				${mrpa_official} is taken aback. "Wha- And who are you supposed to be?" he strikes back, which only fuels your anger.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"A young girl was denied her medication because your friend was too much of a fucking panzy to wait a few days!" Your words are laced with venom.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"You want to know who [i]I'm[/i] supposed to be?! I'm a soldier, I'm risking my life out there to protect you people, protect Morovians, protect your way of life. And the first thing I get to hear when I come back is that a 7-year old girl dead because some enititled Torian burst into the room with his big swinging dick out, and took the medicine she needed to live because he felt like it. You think I can still smile and pretend like everything's sunshine and rainbows knowing this shit is happening right under my nose?!" 
				*line_break

				You're shaking, your breaths heavy. Sweat forms on your brow. You don't know where this anger comes from but… it feels like its been deep withing you this whole time, waiting for an outlet.

				On that note, Mr ${mrpa_official} storms out of the room, leaving you unable to follow.

Another week has passed. Thankfully, your body has recovered just enough for you to walk around with a crutch under you arm. The doctors assure you that in just another week you'll be fit enough to return to the barracks.
*line_break
*line_break
The rest of your men seem to be recovering slower. When you went to visit them, most were still bedridden, but on the path to recovery. Probably 2 weeks before they're fit to return to the barracks. You decide to wait for everyone to heal up before getting everyone back as a unit. 
*line_break
*line_break
No longer confined to your white sheets, you spend most of the last week exploring more of the Haris James Hospital. The doctors were kind enough to let you wander, so long as you returned at the right times for appointments and check-ups. Perhaps they thought following schedules was something a military commander would be disciplined enough to do, and they weren't wrong.
*line_break
*line_break
The Haris James Hospital is a government owned hospital, open to the public. It is well-furnished, with several floors of facilities to wards. At the moment, it is pretty understaffed. According to ${doctor}, once war broke out, a good number of medical staff requested to be relocated elsewhere, or simply resigned. Mostly Torians who fled back to their hometown, she said.
*line_break
*line_break
The hospital receives a majority of its fundings from Torian investors, thus, there is a very evident bias towards them. On one occasion you witnessed a commotion over the counter of a Morovian man having made to wait for several hours, and just a few moments later, a Torian lady came in and was tended to immediately. You wonder; if you had been rejected the day you were brought in because of your race, would you still be alive today?
*line_break

You're wondering about as you do. You somehow manage to make your way up to the higher floors, where there are less people around. Hobbling about the white hallways with a crutch you've grown rather proficient in under your right arm, you indulge in the tranquility, the gentle breeze from the air-conditioner, the subtle smell from the cinnamon you keep in your shirt pocket, a gift from the sweet Doctor ${doctor}…

[b]CRAAAAASHHHHH!!!![/b]
*line_break
*line_break
You flinch at the sudden crashing sound. It sounded like a large metal object had toppled over onto the ground, followed by numerous rattling sounds, almost like ball bearings. You make a 180 degree turn as best as you can and make your way over to the room to your left.
*page_break
You push open the white door with your free hand. Peering in, you see that this is a storage room for medical supplied, with several cabinets, cupboards and drawers lined up against the wall. In the middle of the room, a metallic shelf on wheels lies on its side on the ground. Around 20 bottles of pills are scattered around it - some open with their contents emptied.
*line_break
*line_break
Lying next to the shelf is a man in his 50s, sprawled on the ground. Short in stature, and balding pretty badly, the man dons the same white coat as the doctors you have interacted with.
*line_break
*line_break
He groans, rubbing the back of his head. "Stupid, stupid…" he mutters to himself, unaware of your presence. 
*line_break
*line_break
As he pushes himself off the ground, he notices you standing at the doorway. The two of you lock gazes for a moment.
*line_break
*line_break
"Are you ok? Did you hurt yourself?" you ask, limping forward. In the back of your mind you wonder how strange this must look; a man in crutches offering to help a doctor up.
*line_break
*line_break
"N-no I'm fine!" the doctor waves you away, as he picks himself up. Now able to see his face now, you notice his oddly panicky expression, his forehead glistening with sweat. How bad was his fall? 
*line_break
*line_break
You survey the field of scattered pills of red and blue and yellow and white. You [i[would[/i] offer to help, but unfortunately your current ailments prevent you from doing so.
*line_break
*line_break
"D-don't worry about clumsy ol' me, I just had a little fall, that's all. I'm perfectly fine." he dismisses you with a shaky laugh. "I'll get someone to clean this place up in a moment." The man begins to try and wave you out of the room.
*line_break
*line_break
Something is amiss here. Just… his demeanor, the hint of fear in his tone, and his insistent attempts to push you out of the crime scene. 
*line_break
*line_break
You scan his person over with your eyes, and notice how peculiarly chunky his coat appears, right where the pockets are. You make out the outline of several cylindrical-shapes in his pockets, identical to the bottles strewn about on the floor.
*line_break
*line_break
Is he… stealing the medicine?

		*set charm %+5
		Despite the doctor's best attempts to usher you out, you stand your ground. There's some shady business happening here, and you intend to get to the bottom of it.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The man seems to realize your suspicion, and grows even more flustered. He stammers to find something to say, but you cut him off.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Hey Doc, what do you have there in your pockets?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The short man freezes up, turning ghostly pale. Despite you being on crutches, you seem to hold the high ground, as you still tower over this shuddering old man.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"J-j-just my phone, and my wallet-" he stammers.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Let me see it." your voice overpowers it.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		He hesitates for a while, shuddering before you, nervously playing with the hem of his coat. You recognize the look in his eyes. That look of fear, deciding whether to fight or flee. 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		He comes to a decision, and tries to pull a fast one by suddenly dashing past you on your right side - your handicapped side. But you're ready for him. The crutch under your arm juts out, tripping him mid-dash. The man is sent crashing back to the ground.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		As he topples over, several orange translucent cylinders with white tops fall out of his pockets. Pill bottles. Your suspicions are confirmed.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Before the man can recover, you side-step across to block his exit once more. You ready yourself for any other funny business he may try to pull, maybe he'll sweep your legs, or roll past, or pull a gun out or-
		*line_break
		*line_break
		[b]sniff sniff…[/b]
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You falter. Is he… crying?
		*page_break
		The man doesn't get up after his fall. Instead he grovels in front of you, prostrating himself like you're some deity. Admittedly, it is effective in lowering your guard.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"P-please forgive me.. please just pretend you didn't see me here today."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You pause a moment before pressing for more information. "Who are you, and what were you going to do with this medicine? Sell it?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The man whimpers more at your accusatory tone. "N-no! No, I was going… I was going to use it to treat the Morovians in the outskirts."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I'm sure you have seen the atrocities of this hospital, sir. We have to reject so many Morovians who need medical attention, all because these filthy Torians are hoarding everything to themselves! I… I just wanted to be able to help my fellow Morovians a little more, look out for the little people…"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I offer to treat some of the poorer folks along the outskirts for cheap. Its an… undocumented business, so I need to get my supplies like this. Ooh… I'm so pathetic…"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You consider your options for a moment. You could stop him here, do the hospital a favor and apprehend him here. But his intentions don't appear malicious, perhaps you could just turn a blind eye? Maybe its best to just report this incident to the hospital staff…

			#Apprehend the doctor.
				No… the thought of stealing medicine doesn't sit well with you. You think back to the case of Anastasia, and how she suffered because the medication she needed wasn't there when she needed it. This hospital's biased treatment is far from ideal - but you don't want anyone else to have to suffer like Anastasia.  
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You say firmly, "I know your intentions are good, but I can't allow you to take medicine that's been prescribed for patients here. This isn't the answer!"
				*line_break
				*line_break
				The man looks up at you from his groveling position. His expression contorts in a mixture of shock, sadness, desperation and fear. 
				*line_break
				*line_break
				With no other option, the man yells on survival instinct, and leaps at you.

					You pivot on your left foot, stepping back and to the side so the doctor tackles the air. Pain shoots through your body from the sudden exertion, but you grit your teeth and hold yourself together. Then, you bring your crutch up, and with a quick [b]WHACK[/b] you hit him on the back of the head with the metal instrument. 
					*line_break
					*line_break
					He collapses onto the ground for the third time today. Taking the opportunity, you throw the crutch aside and pin the doctor down to the ground. Holding his  right arm against his back, his left arm pinned by your left foot, and your shin on his thighs, you press your weight down on the man, immobilizing him.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					You begin shouting for help, shouting for someone to assist you. You ignore the doctors whimpers for help. Sure enough, while the floor was quiet, there was still staff hiding in some of the rooms who eventually came over to investigate the source of the commotion.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					Security was called, and the doctor was taken away. You gave your side of the story to the officers and other doctors, and was thanked for your assistance, but was also advised to avoid being directly involved in future matters. 
					*line_break
					*line_break
					Life resumed, though the staff seemed more watchful of you, making sure this crazy commander didn't go wandering into random rooms anymore. You didn't hear about any news of what happened with the doctor - you didn't even know his name, now that you think about it. The hospital likely wanted to keep this incident private. Everyone pretended like nothing had happened, and slowly but surely, the whole debacle faded into a memory.

					*line_break

					In that brief moment of paralysis, the doctor pushed you to the ground. Despite being short and scrawny, his leap was fueled by fear and adrenaline. He overpowers your injured self, and begins pummeling you across the face.

					His blows rain down on you. Your head collides against the marble floor, sending reverberations into your very skull. Your vision gets blurry, the world is spinning.

					You turn to your right to see the familiar figure of ${doctor}, sitting on a stool by your bedside, her legs crossed, a saucer and teacup balanced in her hands.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					"Honestly, are you [i]trying[/i] to stay here longer?" she chides, putting the tea aside. She acts nonchalant, but you know better. Looking at the eye bags under her eyes, the sag in her shoulders… she's been caring for you since you passed out. 
					*line_break
					*line_break
					"I'm… sorry-" You try to apologize, but wince as soon as you make any slight adjustment to your head. It is now that you realize that your entire head has been wrapped up in bandages. 
					*line_break
					*line_break
					${doctor} soothes you and gently adjusts you back into a comfortable position. As she reaches across you, you can't help but take in the homely cinnamon aroma you've come to associate with her. 
					*line_break
					*line_break
					She sighs, returning to her seat. "Alright let's do it this way then. I'm going to ask you some questions, and you can use your fingers to tell me yes or no. 1 finger for yes, 2 for no, okay?"
					*line_break
					*line_break
					You're in no position to reply. Over the course of the next hour, Sonia explained the events that had occurred, and occasionally asked questions to confirm your side of the story.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					You had been found sprawled on the ground of the storage room, unconscious, but thankfully not in critical condition. A few minor concussions that don't seem to pose any immediate harm. 
					*line_break
					*line_break
					You were brought to ${doctor}, who immediately began applying first aid. Meanwhile, security began investigating. They noticed that a number of bottles of important medication had gone missing, and that a certain doctor had not been seen since that morning. With confirmation from your end, ${doctor} confirmed the identity of the doctor, and notified the relevant people.
					*line_break

					1 finger.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					"Did you actually think you could've stopped him in your state?"
					*line_break
					*line_break
					You hesitate for a moment before raising 1 finger. ${doctor} reaches forward to lift a second finger on your hand.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					"Honestly, could you stop making me worry every single day? I can't take my eyes off you for one second." she laments, rubbing the bridge of her nose.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					You smile to yourself. Aww.. she's worried about me.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					${doctor} scribbles something on a clipboard, before placing onto the table side. She gets up, dusts herself off and begins walking out the door. "Well, you seem to be in good condition, so I'm going to get back to tending to my other patients. Try not to get yourself into any more trouble alright?"
					*line_break
					*line_break
					Just before she disappears behind the door frame, she turns to look at your immobile, bandaged self lying on the bed. "Though, looking at you right now, that seems a little difficult. Have a nice week~"

					With a wink, she exits, leaving you to groan internally at the thought of staying stationary for a week. Again.

The man dresses like a typical visitor: white shirt with a gray cardigan over, and some black slacks. His black, tousled hair hides some of his features without looking overly suspicious.

You lean forward, your voice a menacing whisper. "Don't try anything funny. I can shout for help right now and out you where you sit, but I'm going to give you one chance to explain yourself. You even [i]think[/i] about lying, and its curtains for you, you understand me Doc?"

The doctor gulps audibly. "A-alright, the jig is up, I understand, I'll tell you everything. J-just promise you won't tell anyone else what I'm about to tell you alright? Th-th-they'll kill me if they find out!"

You don't show any signs of agreement, and instead use your gaze to press him on. He takes a deep breath before continuing.

"My name is Doctor Karll. I'm a member of the Liberators of Morovia (LOM). I'm sure you've heard of them?"
*line_break

Of course you've heard of them, you think to yourself. Just a few weeks ago you were being shot up by them.

"W-well I know it [i]sounds[/i] bad - the media here certainly makes us sound like some crazy terrorists. But we're just fighting for our rights! We don't want to kill, but these corrupted Torians give us no choice! You know how they are - stealing our jobs, getting preferential treatment, puppeting our  government - What happened to Morovia for Morovians!"

Doctor Karll seems to be getting fired up mid-speech, a true patriot deep within his scaredy-cat persona. Your glowering gaze from across the table tempers his flame, however.

"…my son is in prison because of those damn Torians. He saw a man sexually harassing a lady in a bar. He stopped the man, pushing him aside. He's a gentleman, my boy, as I had raised him to be - though if I had known things would play I like this I nearly wish I hadn't! Turns out that pervert was a Torian, and somehow, with his wealth of connections, he framed my boy for assault! That crooked Torian got away scot-free while my boy sits in jail for being chivalrous! What unjust is this? My honey and I are doing every thing we can to bail him out, but the exorbitant amount they expect from us is impossible for us normal folk! Perhaps those filthy Torians just want to watch us squirm, or maybe they're trying to teach us a lesson."

"Every single day I come into work to treat these Torians. The same dirty Torians who threw my son in jail on a whim. I can't do anything about it! Meanwhile Morovian patients who desperately need our help are being rejected because these freeloading Torians are taking up all the wards! For the most insignificant of illnesses!"

"I began questioning God, why oh why would he make me suffer like this? What had I done to deserve such a fate… but then I received an answer. The LOM approached me, and offered to help my family. In exchange for medicine, they would pay me money to bail my son out-" he opens his hand to show a fistful of green bills that had been palmed to him by the man. "Plus, this medicine will be helping Morovians, so they can recover and fight back the Torian menace! Its a win-win!"

"C-commander… surely you must recognize the problem within our society? These Torians that you work for… they don't care about you. You're just a pawn to them, expendable. If you wish… I can put in a good word with the LOM, I'm sure a commander like you would be most appreciated. If you're not interested in joining, that's fine. Just please… please don't reveal this to anyone… this is my only chance at justice…"

Having finished his monologue, Doctor Karll seems deeply satisfied, like he finally had the chance to get that off his chest. You're unsure what to feel. You don't get the sense that the doctor is lying, and his depiction of Torians certainly lines up with what you've witnessed over the last few weeks.

What will you do?
	#Agree to join the LOM (verbal agreement only)
	#Refuse to join, but will not expose Doctor Karll
	#Threaten the doctor.
	#Expose Doctor Karll to Doctor ${doctor}
	#Blackmail Doctor Karll for some of his profits.

As the lift doors open, you enter the cafeteria? The delicious aroma of freshly toasted bread, savory fried chicken and perhaps a creamy mushroom soup hits you in the face.Given that its lunch time, the place is packed with doctors, nurses, vistitors and patients.

Miraculously, ${doctor} and you find a secluded table for two.
