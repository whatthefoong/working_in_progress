Another mundane day. You lie in your pristine white hospital bed, in the same position as you were for the entire week. 
*line_break
*line_break
After regaining consciousness, the first thing you did was call back to HQ. You updated them on your situation during the fight (though Sergeant ${sergeant} seemed to have already given them that information) as well as the current status of your injured members. Higher-ups assured you that the situation at Orlotek is being handled, and assure you that you can rest easy, and report again when all soldiers have recovered and are ready to return to the barracks.
*line_break
*line_break
In your time here, you've tried to make small talk with your fellow patients, but they're usually sedated or too exhausted to talk. The staff don't entertain your attempts at casual conversation either. They come in, change your bandages, scribble things on a clipboard, then leave. How diligent.
*line_break
*line_break
The only person who has even tried conversing with you is ${doctor}. If only she were here, you think to yourself.
*line_break
*line_break
As if on cue, your train of thought is broken abruptly by a commotion just outside the ward.
*line_break
*line_break
"You can't be fucking serious!"
*line_break
*line_break
Its Doctor ${doctor}. Her voice is raised and laced with venom, uncharacteristic of what you know of her.
*line_break
*line_break
"We didn't have a choice, ${doctor}. You know how this place works." A monotone voice replies, unprovoked by Sonia.
*line_break
*line_break
"That doesn't make this okay! We could have saved her, if we had just-"
*line_break
*line_break
"Look, I don't like this just as much as you do, but there's nothing we can do now. Cool yourself off and get back to work."
*line_break
*line_break
You hear footsteps of what you presume is ${doctor}'s coworker grows softer away from the ward as they walk away from the conversation.
*line_break
*line_break
${doctor} enters the room, her face haggard, her hand resting on the door frame to support herself. Her eyes are glazed over, defeated. After a moment of staring at the ground she turns up, noticing your presence.
*line_break
*line_break
She smiles weakly. "Sorry you had to hear all that, ${name}.
*fake_choice
	#What happened?
		"So you were eavesdropping?" she asks coyly, cocking an eyebrow. 		She chuckles as you try to find an excuse. 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Relax, I'm only teasing. Hearing someone yelling across the hallway shouldn't be considered eavesdropping." she jokes as she walks towards you.
	#You look tired, are you alright?
		*set relationship_sonia %+5
		Her expression lightens. "What kind of doctor am I, letting the patient comfort me." she chides herself under her breath.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I'm fine, thank you for asking." she straightens her back, walking towards you. 
	#I can knock the daylights out of him if you want.
		*set relationship_sonia %-5
		*set violence +1
		She shakes her head. "Honestly commander, not everything needs to be settled with violence."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I appreciate you looking out for me, but he's my coworker, my friend. No need for punching." she smiles patiently as she begins walking towards you.
*line_break
*line_break
She leans against the wall, reaches into her inner pocket for a stick of cinnamon, bringing it close to her nose.
*line_break
*line_break
"One of my patients here is a kid. Her name is Anastasia, a Morovian girl, only 7 years old. She had the most beautiful black eyes and the rosiest cheeks, just the sweetest bundle of joy." ${doctor} explains, smiling at the image.
*line_break
*line_break
"She suffers from a specific lung disease. Its fatal if untreated, but luckily when she was brought in while we could still save her. She's been in our care for about 2 months now, and is… was, recovering. In less than a month she might even have been discharged, able to go back to living like a normal kid."
*line_break
*line_break
${doctor} pauses. "But then we got a new patient. A politician, middle-aged guy. Same disease, coincidentally. He was still in the mild stages of the disease. He could have lived healthily for another 6 months. But he demanded to be treated immediately. We only had so much of the medicine available here. I prescribed him some mild painkillers for his chest pain and told him to wait for the next shipment arriving in 2 months."
*line_break
*line_break
"Last night, Anastasia's condition escalated. When I went to look for the medication… it wasn't there. With no other choice, I put her on laughing gas to ease the pain." ${doctor}'s expression hardens. "The entire time she was smiling, smiling through the tears, smiling through the pain. She said… she trusted me to save her."
*line_break
*line_break
There's a long pause. 
*line_break
*line_break
"After 6 hours, Anastasia passed away this morning."
*page_break
"When my coworkers came in just now, I asked what happened to the medicine. Apparently, the new patient went straight to the board of hospital directors, asking to be treated by another doctor without my notice. The hospital directors agreed."
*line_break
*line_break
"Because of the way things are… because he was [i]Torian[/i]… we had to listen to him. We used the last of the medication. And because of that, she's dead."
*line_break
*line_break
From your perspective you can't see her face. Her eyes are obscured by her bangs which haven't been clipped up like usually are. But she's trembling.
*line_break
*line_break
The stick of spice in her hand suddenly snaps in her grip. Both of you watch the two halves hit the floor.
*line_break
*line_break
She laughs sadly at all of this. "Maybe I should trade these cinnamon sticks for blunts…"
*fake_choice
	#You did your best.
		She doesn't look at you. "If 'my best' is watching a 7-year old die, then 'my best' isn't good enough."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"		There's no use berating yourself like this. There was nothing more you could have done." you try to rationalize. "You stayed by her side the whole night, you did your best to ease her pain. You're a great doctor, Ms ${doctor}. I'm sure Anastasia thought the same."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		She sighs, massaging the bridge of her nose in an attempt to compose herself.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Yes… Listen, I'm… I'm sorry, I don't mean to be all pessimistic like this. Thanks for trying to cheer me up. I just… need time." 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You nod, able to understand some of the grief she must be going through.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I just wonder… if Anastasia had been born a Torian… would I still get to see her smile today? This Torian, Morovian divide… it has to end." 
		*page_break
	#Fuckin Torians...
		"Fuckin Torians…" you unconsciously mutter under your breath. You find yourself surprised by your own words. The MRPA is made up of mostly Torian supporters, and you hadn't thought to question them until now.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		There's a moment of silence between the two of you.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Yup, those are our bosses." ${doctor} mutters. "This whole hospital is funded by them too, so we don't really get a say in these decisions." 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I'm a foreigner. I came here because I wanted to save people. I don't care if you're Torian, Morovian, Hadan, whatever. I'll treat you if you're hurt. Because regardless of your birthplace, your life is precious."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		She bends down to pick up the broken cinnamon stick. "I understand its not so simple for you folks. But this unfairness… it just can't go on."
		*page_break
	#This is just the world we live in, unfortunately.
		"What can we do? We're tiny pieces on this giant game board of politics, we can't change the way things are." You laugh at the futility of it all. 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		${doctor} is silent. "Do you truly believe that?" 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The sudden resolve in her voice surprises you. "No that's not-" you stammer, trying to restate your intentions.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"No its fine, I'm not accusing you of anything." she reassures. "Its just that… maybe I'm just an optimist, but I think we can do better."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"This whole Torian vs Morovian situation is stupid to me. This divide has taken so many lives… why do we keep doing these things to ourselves?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Maybe I'm just some naive foreigner, but if you're my patient, I don't care if you're Morovian, Torian or Hadan, I'll still treat you. Because regardless of your birthplace, your life is precious." 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Her sense of purpose and ambition shakes you, and makes you ponder about your own life. What have you been fighting for?
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Sorry, I just blurted some things out. I think I just need to get some rest." ${doctor} says, rubbing her puffy tired eyes.
		*page_break
At the worst possible timing, there's a knock on the door. Sonia quickly makes herself presentable. She throws the broken cinnamon into the bin, rubs the tears in her eyes, and arranges her hair neatly before answering "Come in." 
*line_break
*line_break
The door swings wide open as a large man sporting a XL-sized black suit enters. He has a shiny bald head, which reflects the light directly into your eyes as he enters the ward, dazing you. He has a… rounded figure, and lumbers rather than walks. At his collar he displays a bright red bow-tie. What brings this cartoon-brought-to-life here, you think to yourself. 
*line_break
*line_break
"Ah Good Morning! You must be Doctor ${doctor}, its a pleasure to meet you." he cheerily greets the doctor, his voice as large as his person. ${doctor} has regained her composure, shaking his hand (which engulfs her's). "The pleasure is mine, Mr…"
*line_break
*line_break
"${mrpa_official} Maximov, at your service! Ah, but Mr ${mrpa_official} is fine, Mr Maximov would be my father!" He laughs heartily. Sonia back smiles politely.
*line_break
*line_break
""Well Mr ${mrpa_official}, what can I help you with today?" Sonia puts her hands into the pockets of her coat. Looking at the 2 of them side by side, it looks as though a corgi is talking up to an elephant. Its almost comical.
*line_break
*line_break
"I just had to come in person to thank the doctor who saved my good friend, [b]Mr Garcia[/b]."
*line_break
*line_break
At the mention of the name, for a split-second you watch ${doctor}'s composure drop. There is a sudden intensity in her eyes, the veins on the side of her head tensing. Mr ${mrpa_official} seems to not have noticed this, however, as he continues blabbering.
*line_break
*line_break
"He was in a terrible state, honestly. Every time I met him he would look so pale, and have these deep eye bags. He would just go on and on about having trouble sleeping, and having chest pains up to - get this, 3 times a day! Can you imagine that, just suddenly feeling pain in the middle of the night? That must have been horrid! I told him to go to the hospital, go see a doctor, and he just kept refusing and refusing until finally he decided to give it a try and - wouldn't you know, he had a [i]rare lung disease![/i] Thank goodness I pushed him to get some professional help, heaven knows what kind of state he would've been. I tell you doc, I have a knack of knowing these kinds of things - maybe [i]I[/i] should be a doctor! Hohohoho, kidding~"
*line_break
*line_break
Sonia smiles throughout the man's incessant prattle. She seems to want to interrupt him, tell him that it wasn't her that treated his friend, but is unable to find the right time to. The mention of this Mr Garcia's rare lung disease and Sonia's hints of discomfort allow you to put two and two together: Mr Garcia was the reason why there wasn't enough medication for Anastasia.

		"Hey!"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The duo look at you as you interrupted their one-sided conversation abruptly. There is an intensity in your voice you hadn't expected.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		${doctor} picks up on the animosity in your voice. She looks at you with, cautioning you to remain calm.

				You take a deep breath to control yourself. This isn't the warfront, these are civilians, you remind yourself.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"I apologize for eavesdropping, but I heard the mention of a Mr Garcia and a rare lung disease? Might I ask, did the doctors say he needed to be treated immediately? Or did he demand to be."
				*line_break
				*line_break
				Mr ${mrpa_official} is taken aback by your roundabout accusation. "Wait a moment, who are you-"
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You raise both hands up to show you mean no harm. "I'm just Ms ${doctor} patient and friend. News travels quickly in this place, I just want to confirm a few things I've been hearing."
				*line_break
				*line_break
				${mrpa_official} looks at you quizzically, unsure as if whether he should be talking to this stranger. His blabbermouth wins out, however, and he answers you.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"W-well, erm… I'm afraid I don't know the specifics but I believe the doctors told him that his condition wasn't particularly dire. B-but I mean, I don't see the harm in getting treatment earlier, after all as the saying goes its best to 'nip it in the bud', wouldn't you agree-"
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You cut him off again. "What if there wasn't enough medicine? What if there was someone else who desperately needed the treatment more than your friend, and because he demanded the treatment like a child, the people who desperately need it are denied?"
				*line_break
				*line_break
				${mrpa_official} looks increasingly uncomfortable, though seemingly unsure of what exactly is the issue. "W-what in blazes are you balbbering about?"
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You tell him everything ${doctor} told you. You tell him about Anastasia, the sweet girl with the same disease. You tell of ${doctor}'s refusal to treat Mr Garcia, given his relatively stable condition to Anastasia. You tell him of the events of last night, and the ordeal both Anastasia and ${doctor} had to go through.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				Mr ${mrpa_official}'s expression changes from anger to shock. He looks at Doctor ${doctor	} to see if what you say is true, and she simply nods slightly, her expression unreadable. 
				*line_break
				*line_break
				When you finish, ${mrpa_official} looks distraught. "I… I must speak to Mr Garcia about this immediately." He darts out of the room, faster than you have ever thought possible for him.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				You sigh, satisfied that the truth has been spoken. Sonia strides up to your side, quietly, her face obscured by shadow. 
				*line_break
				*line_break
				Maybe she's here to thank yo-
				*line_break
				*line_break
				She punches you in the gut, right where it hurts the most.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				Granted, it wasn't [i]that[/i] hard of a punch, but she nailed you in the sorest part of your body. You double over in pain.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				She looks down on you with no sympathy. "That's for revealing confidential information, asshat. I could've dealt with that myself."
				*line_break

				Watching you roll around in agony, her threatening facade breaks, and she giggles quietly to herself.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				She sighs, pulling out a fresh stick of cinnamon from her coat. "Still, I'm glad the truth is out. Thanks for sticking your neck out for me. I'm sure… I'm sure Anastasia will be able to rest easy now." 
				*line_break
				*line_break
				She smells the cinnamon for a moment, then kisses it gently, before putting it by your bedside. 
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"Well, I've wasted enough time here. Bye." She exits, with renewed energy. 
				*line_break

				"Did you know that a child died yesterday, because of your [i]dear Mr Garcia[/i]?" The animosity in your voice is very evident at the moment. 
				*line_break
				*line_break
				${mrpa_official} is taken aback. "Wha- And who are you supposed to be?" he strikes back, which only fuels your anger.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"A young girl was denied her medication because your friend was too much of a fucking panzy to wait a few days!" Your words are laced with venom.
				*line_break
				*line_break
				"You want to know who [i]I'm[/i] supposed to be?! I'm a soldier, I'm risking my life out there to protect you people, protect Morovians, protect your way of life. And the first thing I get to hear when I come back is that a 7-year old girl dead because some enititled Torian burst into the room with his big swinging dick out, and took the medicine she needed to live because he felt like it. You think I can still smile and pretend like everything's sunshine and rainbows knowing this shit is happening right under my nose?!"

				On that note, Mr ${mrpa_official} storms out of the room, leaving you unable to follow.

Another week has passed. Thankfully, your body has recovered just enough for you to walk around with a crutch under you arm. The doctors assure you that in just another week you'll be fit enough to return to the barracks.
*line_break
*line_break
The rest of your men seem to be recovering slower. When you went to visit them, most were still bedridden, but on the path to recovery. Probably 2 weeks before they're fit to return to the barracks. You decide to wait for everyone to heal up before getting everyone back as a unit. 
*line_break
*line_break
No longer confined to your white sheets, you spend most of the last week exploring more of the Haris James Hospital. The doctors were kind enough to let you wander, so long as you returned at the right times for appointments and check-ups. Perhaps they thought following schedules was something a military commander would be disciplined enough to do, and they weren't wrong.
*line_break
*line_break
The Haris James Hospital is a government owned hospital, open to the public. It is well-furnished, with several floors of facilities to wards. At the moment, it is pretty understaffed. According to ${doctor}, once war broke out, a good number of medical staff requested to be relocated elsewhere, or simply resigned. Mostly Torians who fled back to their hometown, she said.
*line_break
*line_break
The hospital receives a majority of its fundings from Torian investors, thus, there is a very evident bias towards them. On one occasion you witnessed a commotion over the counter of a Morovian man having made to wait for several hours, and just a few moments later, a Torian lady came in and was tended to immediately. You wonder; if you had been rejected the day you were brought in because of your race, would you still be alive today?
*line_break

You're wondering about as you do. You somehow manage to make your way up to the higher floors, where there are less people around. Hobbling about the white hallways with a crutch you've grown rather proficient in under your right arm, you indulge in the tranquility, the gentle breeze from the air-conditioner, the subtle smell from the cinnamon you keep in your shirt pocket, a gift from the sweet Doctor ${doctor}…

[b]CRAAAAASHHHHH!!!![/b]
*line_break
*line_break
You flinch at the sudden crashing sound. It sounded like a large metal object had toppled over onto the ground, followed by numerous rattling sounds, almost like ball bearings. You make a 180 degree turn as best as you can and make your way over to the room to your left.
*page_break
You push open the white door with your free hand. Peering in, you see that this is a storage room for medical supplied, with several cabinets, cupboards and drawers lined up against the wall. In the middle of the room, a metallic shelf on wheels lies on its side on the ground. Around 20 bottles of pills are scattered around it - some open with their contents emptied.
*line_break
*line_break
Lying next to the shelf is a man in his 50s, sprawled on the ground. Short in stature, and balding pretty badly, the man dons the same white coat as the doctors you have interacted with.
*line_break
*line_break
He groans, rubbing the back of his head. "Stupid, stupid…" he mutters to himself, unaware of your presence. 
*line_break
*line_break
As he pushes himself off the ground, he notices you standing at the doorway. The two of you lock gazes for a moment.
*line_break
*line_break
"Are you ok? Did you hurt yourself?" you ask, limping forward. In the back of your mind you wonder how strange this must look; a man in crutches offering to help a doctor up.
*line_break
*line_break
"N-no I'm fine!" the doctor waves you away, as he picks himself up. Now able to see his face now, you notice his oddly panicky expression, his forehead glistening with sweat. How bad was his fall? 
*line_break
*line_break
You survey the field of scattered pills of red and blue and yellow and white. You [i[would[/i] offer to help, but unfortunately your current ailments prevent you from doing so.
*line_break
*line_break
"D-don't worry about clumsy ol' me, I just had a little fall, that's all. I'm perfectly fine." he dismisses you with a shaky laugh. "I'll get someone to clean this place up in a moment." The man begins to try and wave you out of the room.
*line_break
*line_break
Something is amiss here. Just… his demeanor, the hint of fear in his tone, and his insistent attempts to push you out of the crime scene. 
*line_break
*line_break
You scan his person over with your eyes, and notice how peculiarly chunky his coat appears, right where the pockets are. You make out the outline of several cylindrical-shapes in his pockets, identical to the bottles strewn about on the floor.
*line_break
*line_break
Is he… stealing the medicine?

		Despite the doctor's best attempts to usher you out, you stand your ground. There's some shady business happening here, and you intend to get to the bottom of it.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The man seems to realize your suspicion, and grows even more flustered. He stammers to find something to say, but you cut him off.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Hey Doc, what do you have there in your pockets?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The short man freezes up, turning ghostly pale. Despite you being on crutches, you seem to hold the high ground, as you still tower over this shuddering old man.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"J-j-just my phone, and my wallet-" he stammers.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Let me see it." your voice overpowers it.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		He hesitates for a while, shuddering before you, nervously playing with the hem of his coat. You recognize the look in his eyes. That look of fear, deciding whether to fight or flee. 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		He comes to a decision, and tries to pull a fast one by suddenly dashing past you on your right side - your handicapped side. But you're ready for him. The crutch under your arm juts out, tripping him mid-dash. The man is sent crashing back to the ground.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		As he topples over, several orange translucent cylinders with white tops fall out of his pockets. Pill bottles. Your suspicions are confirmed.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Before the man can recover, you side-step across to block his exit once more. You ready yourself for any other funny business he may try to pull, maybe he'll sweep your legs, or roll past, or pull a gun out or-
		*line_break
		*line_break
		[b]sniff sniff…[/b]
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You falter. Is he… crying?
		*page_break
		The man doesn't get up after his fall. Instead he grovels in front of you, prostrating himself like you're some deity. Admittedly, it is effective in lowering your guard.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"P-please forgive me.. please just pretend you didn't see me here today."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You pause a moment before pressing for more information. "Who are you, and what were you going to do with this medicine? Sell it?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The man whimpers more at your accusatory tone. "N-no! No, I was going… I was going to use it to treat the Morovians in the outskirts."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I'm sure you have seen the atrocities of this hospital, sir. We have to reject so many Morovians who need medical attention, all because these filthy Torians are hoarding everything to themselves! I… I just wanted to be able to help my fellow Morovians a little more, look out for the little people…"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I offer to treat some of the poorer folks along the outskirts for cheap. Its an… undocumented business, so I need to get my supplies like this. Ooh… I'm so pathetic…"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You consider your options for a moment. You could stop him here, do the hospital a favor and apprehend him here. But his intentions don't appear malicious, perhaps you could just turn a blind eye? Maybe its best to just report this incident to the hospital staff…

			#Apprehend the doctor.
				No… the thought of stealing medicine doesn't sit well with you. You think back to the case of Anastasia, and how she suffered because the medication she needed wasn't there when she needed it. This hospital's biased treatment is far from ideal - but you don't want anyone else to have to suffer like Anastasia.

				You say firmly, "I know your intentions are good, but I can't allow you to take medicine that's been prescribed for patients here. This isn't the answer!"
				*line_break
				*line_break
				The man looks up at you from his groveling position. His expression contorts in a mixture of shock, sadness, desperation and fear. 
				*line_break

				With no other option, the man yells on survival instinct, and leaps at you.

Pain shoots through your body from the sudden exertion, but you grit your teeth and hold yourself together. Then, you bring your crutch up, and with a quick [b]WHACK[/b] you hit him on the back of the head with the metal instrument. 
					*line_break

					He collapses onto the ground for the third time today. Taking the opportunity, you throw the crutch aside and pin the doctor down to the ground. Holding his  right arm against his back, his left arm pinned by your left foot, and your shin on his thighs, you press your weight down on the man, immobilizing him.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					You begin shouting for help, shouting for someone to assist you. You ignore the doctors whimpers for help. Sure enough, while the floor was quiet, there was still staff hiding in some of the rooms who eventually came over to investigate the source of the commotion.

					Security was called, and the doctor was taken away. You gave your side of the story to the officers and other doctors, and was thanked for your assistance, but was also advised to avoid being directly involved in future matters.

					Life resumed, though the staff seemed more watchful of you, making sure this crazy commander didn't go wandering into random rooms anymore. You didn't hear about any news of what happened with the doctor - you didn't even know his name, now that you think about it. The hospital likely wanted to keep this incident private. Everyone pretended like nothing had happened, and slowly but surely, the whole debacle faded into a memory.

					*line_break
					*line_break
					"Honestly, are you [i]trying[/i] to stay here longer?" she chides, putting the tea aside. She acts nonchalant, but you know better. Looking at the eye bags under her eyes, the sag in her shoulders… she's been caring for you since you passed out. 
					*line_break
					*line_break
					"I'm… sorry-" You try to apologize, but wince as soon as you make any slight adjustment to your head. It is now that you realize that your entire head has been wrapped up in bandages. 
					*line_break
					*line_break
					${doctor} soothes you and gently adjusts you back into a comfortable position. As she reaches across you, you can't help but take in the homely cinnamon aroma you've come to associate with her. 
					*line_break
					*line_break
					She sighs, returning to her seat. "Alright let's do it this way then. I'm going to ask you some questions, and you can use your fingers to tell me yes or no. 1 finger for yes, 2 for no, okay?"
					*line_break

					You're in no position to reply. Over the course of the next hour, Sonia explained the events that had occurred, and occasionally asked questions to confirm your side of the story.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					You had been found sprawled on the ground of the storage room, unconscious, but thankfully not in critical condition. A few minor concussions that don't seem to pose any immediate harm. 
					*line_break
					*line_break
					You were brought to ${doctor}, who immediately began applying first aid. Meanwhile, security began investigating. They noticed that a number of bottles of important medication had gone missing, and that a certain doctor had not been seen since that morning.

					"Did you actually think you could've stopped him in your state?"
					*line_break
					*line_break
					You hesitate for a moment before raising 1 finger. ${doctor} reaches forward to lift a second finger on your hand.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					"Honestly, could you stop making me worry every single day? I can't take my eyes off you for one second." she laments, rubbing the bridge of her nose.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					You smile to yourself. Aww.. she's worried about me, you think.
					*line_break
					*line_break
					${doctor} scribbles something on a clipboard, before placing onto the table side. She gets up, dusts herself off and begins walking out the door. "Well, you seem to be in good condition, so I'm going to get back to tending to my other patients. Try not to get yourself into any more trouble alright?"
					*line_break

					Just before she disappears behind the door frame, she turns to look at your immobile, bandaged self lying on the bed. "Though, looking at you right now, that seems a little difficult. Have a nice week~"

	You take the initiative to play the bad cop in this situation. You pressure him, 
"Your coat's looking a lot lighter now… where did those pills go?"
*line_break
*line_break
The doctor turns ghostly pale. He might just fade into nothing if you keep prodding him.
*line_break

You lean forward, your voice a menacing whisper. "Don't try anything funny.

	Doctor ${doc	tor} elbows you lightly, indicating for you to lower the intensity. She sighs, then asks her colleague "Karll, please. Just tell us what's happening here. We could have called the authorities right away, but we wanted to at least hear you out. Alright?" 
	*line_break
	*line_break
The doctor gulps audibly. "A-alright, the jig is up, I understand, I'll tell you everything. J-just promise you won't tell anyone else what I'm about to tell you alright? Th-th-they'll kill me if they find out!"

	You don't show any signs of agreement, and instead use your gaze to press him on.

He takes a deep breath before continuing.

	"My name is Doctor Karll.

	"
I'm a member of the Liberators of Morovia (LOM). I'm sure you've heard of them?"
*line_break
*line_break
Of course you've heard of them, you think to yourself. Just a few weeks ago you were being shot up by them.
*line_break
*line_break
"W-well I know it [i]sounds[/i] bad - the media here certainly makes us sound like some crazy terrorists. But we're just fighting for our rights! We don't want to kill, but these corrupted Torians give us no choice! You know how they are - stealing our jobs, getting preferential treatment, puppeting our  government - What happened to Morovia for Morovians!"
*line_break
*line_break
Doctor Karll seems to be getting fired up mid-speech, a true patriot deep within his scaredy-cat persona. Your glowering gaze from across the table tempers his flame, however.
*line_break
*line_break
"…my son is in prison because of those damn Torians. He saw a man sexually harassing a lady in a bar. He stopped the man, pushing him aside. He's a gentleman, my boy, as I had raised him to be - though if I had known things would play I like this I nearly wish I hadn't! Turns out that pervert was a Torian, and somehow, with his wealth of connections, he framed my boy for assault! That crooked Torian got away scot-free while my boy sits in jail for being chivalrous! What unjust is this? My honey and I are doing every thing we can to bail him out, but the exorbitant amount they expect from us is impossible for us normal folk! Perhaps those filthy Torians just want to watch us squirm, or maybe they're trying to teach us a lesson."
*line_break
*line_break
"Every single day I come into work to treat these Torians. The same dirty Torians who threw my son in jail on a whim. I can't do anything about it! Meanwhile Morovian patients who desperately need our help are being rejected because these freeloading Torians are taking up all the wards! For the most insignificant of illnesses!"
*line_break
*line_break
"I began questioning God, why oh why would he make me suffer like this? What had I done to deserve such a fate… but then I received an answer. The LOM approached me, and offered to help my family. In exchange for medicine, they would pay me money to bail my son out-" he opens his hand to show a fistful of green bills that had been palmed to him by the man. "Plus, this medicine will be helping Morovians, so they can recover and fight back the Torian menace! Its a win-win!"

	"C-commander… surely you must recognize the problem within our society? These Torians that you work for… they don't care about you. You're just a pawn to them, expendable.

Having finished his monologue, Doctor Karll seems deeply satisfied, like he finally had the chance to get that off his chest. You're unsure what to feel.

What will you do?
	#Agree to join the LOM (verbal agreement only)
		The past few weeks, you've been seriously thinking about the Torian vs Morovian conflict in earnest. Somehow, for a majority of your life you had been avoiding the subject, simply taking things as they were. But perhaps… perhaps your skirmish in Orlotek awoke something within you. The near-death experience brought your loyalty into question. Are you fighting for something you believe in?
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You spend a long time deep in your thoughts. Doctor Karll sits in front of you, waiting patiently, his fate still resting in your hands.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Eventually you snap out of it. You have settled on an answer.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Alright."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The doctor eyes widen, unable to believe what he just heard. "I-I'm sorry, could you repeat that?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		*if soniaconfront = 1
			${doctor} turns to you as well, eyes wide in bewilderment. You avoid her gaze.
			*line_break
			*line_break
		You sigh. "Alright, I'll join the LOM. As long as its nothing too dangerous, I… I'd like to do my part in fighting the injustice."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		For a moment Doctor Karll is elated, still unsure as to how he managed to turn the tides of this situation into his favor. He composes himself, but is much more comfortable now.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"V-very good, I'll put in a good word for you with my contact then. I'll let you know if I receive any updates."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		*if soniaconfront = 1
			He looks at ${doctor}, expectant for an answer. However her eyes are still glued on you. Only when Doctor Karll clears his throat does ${doctor} finally tear her gaze away from you.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			"I'm… not interested in joining, but rest assured… I'll keep this a secret between us."
			*line_break
			*line_break
			Doctor Karll deflates slightly at the rejection, but nods in understanding.
			*line_break
			*line_break
		There's a palpable awkwardness in the air now. After a little bit of thumb-twiddling, Doctor Karll bids 
		*if soniaconfront = 0
			you 
		*if soniaconfront = 1
			the two of you 
		farewell, 			hops off his stool, and leaves. He walks past you, still in deep contemplation, and whispers "Welcome to the right side, Commander."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		*if soniaconfront = 0
			You are left alone with your thoughts.
		*if soniaconfront = 1
			The two of you are now alone. Despite the chatter of the cafeteria, the atmosphere is so tense it seems to suffocate you.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			${doctor} breaks the silence. "Did you mean that? Are you actually serious about joining them?"
			*line_break
			*line_break
			You scratch you chin lightly. "No… If what Doctor Karll says is true, then this extends far beyond the hospital. With this I have a lead into the LOM, opens up new avenues, maybe I can infiltrate them from the inside… this is a useful position…"
			*line_break
			*line_break
			Doctor ${doctor} doesn't seem very convinced. Hell, [i]you're[/i] not entirely convinced with your own answer.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			${doctor} exhales loudly. "Allright then, if you say so… just don't endanger yourself too much alright?"
			*line_break
			*line_break
			She rises from the chair. "I've… got some work to do, so I'll go on ahead. See you around, soldier." With that, she pats you gently on the back before walking out of the cafeteria.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You're still unsure if you were telling th truth. Part of you thinks you only said that to follow a lead, infiltrate the LOM and destroy it from the inside. But another part… it scares you.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You get up from your seat, walking away from the cafeteria, walking away from everything. You've lost your appetite, and you just want to be alone for now.

	#Refuse to join, but will not expose Doctor Karll
		You mind is abuzz with conflicting thoughts. Stealing medicine is wrong… but so is the unjust treatment of Torians against Morovians… do two wrongs make a right? It shouldn't, clearly you know this, but… who are you to stop this poor man from saving his son?
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You spend a long time deep in your thoughts. Doctor Karll sits in front of you, waiting patiently, his fate still resting in your hands.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Eventually you snap out of it. You have settled on an answer.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Go."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The doctor tilts his head to one side, unsure of what you're trying to say.
		*if soniaconfront = 1
			*line_break
			*line_break
			${doctor} looks at you from the corner of her eye, but doesn't say anything.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You take a deep breath. "I'm not going to join the LOM. I have my own family to protect too. But I understand you're only trying your best for your son, so I'm not going to report this, or tell anyone about what I saw today. Just don't let me catch you again, alright?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You don't meet his gaze, as if ashamed by the words coming out of your mouth.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The doctor hesitates. "Do you… Can I trust you-"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You shoot a glare at him to shut him up. "Go, before I change my mind."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		*if soniaconfront = 0
			Doctor Karll gulps, and gets off the chair, leaving you. As he walks past he mutters, "Thank you for sparing me, Commander, it truly means a lot."
		*if sonia confront = 1
			Doctor Karll gulps, and turns to look at ${doctor} for a second opinion. She nods, indicating that she shares the same decision. 
			*line_break
			*line_break
			The man hops off the chair, leaving the two of you alone. As he walks past he mutters, "Thank you both for sparing me, it truly means a lot."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You run your fingers through your hair, exasperated, exhausted. Choosing the path of inaction… surely if nobody finds out, you won't be held responsible? No, you can't be held responsible for anything that happens after this… right?
		*line_break
		*line_break
		*if soniaconfront = 0
			Unable to come to a decision, you get up from your seat and grab some food. The food today isn't as good as it normally is… 
			*line_break
			*line_break
			There's a bitter taste in your mouth.
		*if soniaconfront = 1
			You hear an exasperated sigh to your side, as your accomplice leans forward, crumpling into herself before sitting upright. She looks at you, looking just as wary as you feel.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			"Well… we just let a criminal loose." she quips dryly. You try to laugh but only manage an exhale from the nose. 
			*line_break
			*line_break
			A moment of silence passes between the two of you. Out of exhaustion, ${doctor} buries her head in her hands.
			*line_break
			*line_break
			"Did we… are we doing the right thing?" she asks. 
			*line_break
			*line_break
			You reach across her to give her a side hug. "We're trying… and that's the best we can do."
			*line_break
			*line_break
			Despite your best efforts to sound encouraging, you're unsure whether you believe your own words. Regardless, the two of you let reality sink in for a moment before parting to return to your daily duties.

	#Expose the doctor.
		You spend a good while considering your options. You sympathize with the doctor, really, you do. Family is important, you would do anything to protect your own family too. But two wrongs don't make a right. Despite the corruption of the Torians… stealing medicine is unacceptable. You don't want another case like Anastasia, another case of a patient having to die because medication specifically prescribed for them isn't there when they need it the most.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You slowly look up to meet the gaze of the doctor, who had been waiting patiently for your answer, for you to decide his fate.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Your eyes are filled with steely cold determination. His eyes widen, as he realizes the decision you have come to.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I'm sorry Doc… but you know this is wrong."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Doctor Karll is trembling harder than he's ever been. His lips are quivering, and tears are beginning to form at the corner of his eyes. "P-p-please commander, not like this…"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You continue without hesitation. "Theft of government-owned resources is a crime, regardless of the intention behind it."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Tears are trickling down his face. Snot dribbles down his nose. He is a mess, realizing that this is the end of the line for him. The commuters around you have begun to pay attention to you two.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		*if soniaconfront = 1
			Karll turns to ${doctor} for support, sobbing, but she looks away, looking at the ground. "Sorry Karll… you did this to yourself."
			*line_break
			*line_break
		"As an officer of the MRPA… you are under arrest."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Before you can finish your sentence, the doctor makes a break for it, crying out for his life. Doing your best to keep up, crutch under your arm, you shout "Stop that doctor! He's a thief!". Though most of the people in the cafeteria are too stunned to intervene, the crowd makes movement difficult for the doctor. Eventually, security arrives, apprehending the ruined doctor.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		*if soniaconfront = 0		
			Authorities were called. The doctor was taken away, and you never saw him again. You gave your side of the story to the officers and other doctors, and was thanked for your assistance. Reporting the crime to the relevant parties was a good move on your part, they said.
		*if soniaconfront = 1
			${doctor} called the authorities. The doctor was taken away, and you never saw him again. Both ${doctor} and you had to give your sides of the story to the officers, and were thanked for your assistance. Reporting the crime to the relevant parties was the right thing to do, they said.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Life resumed, though the staff seemed more watchful of you, making sure this crazy commander didn't go wandering into random rooms anymore. You didn't hear about any news of what happened with Doctor Karll. The hospital likely wanted to keep this incident private. Everyone pretended like nothing had happened, and slowly but surely, the whole debacle faded into a memory.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		*if soniaconfront = 0
			You remember, though. Only you seemed to care about Doctor Karll's story. When you told the authorities about how the Torians had framed his son for a crime he didn't do, they dismissed you hurriedly.
		*if soniaconfront = 1
			You and ${doctor} remember, however. Every time you saw ${doctor} you wanted to bring up the topic, but somehow couldn't find a right way of doing so. It felt like such a charged subject that it would be better not to even bring it up. 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You ponder whether the choice you made was right, whether there was a way that could have turned out better. If Doctor Karll's story was true, then his son will likely rot in jail until the Torians decide to let him go. Hell, they might even forget about him, leaving him to rot in a cell, wondering if his parents had abandoned him.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		No, you were just doing your job. Unfortunate cases like this happen everywhere, you're no superhero; it's not your responsibility to save everyone. Yeah… you were just doing your job, nothing wrong with that, is there?

		You spend a long time deep in your thoughts. Doctor Karll sits in front of you, waiting patiently, his fate still resting in your hands.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You stare at the amount of green in his enclosed palm. Shit… that's at least a 1000 dollars, made in just 15 minutes? Plus, Doctor Karll was in no way a good thief, as you recall his shifty nervous attitude throughout your conversation. You could certainly do a much better job, couldn't you?
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You think back to your family, and the money problems they have been facing over these recent years. Your military pay which, while certainly stable and not a small amount, is nothing compared to earning 1000 bucks in a single day.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		A sinister thought enters your mind.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Doc… if word gets out that you're doing this you'll be ruined, you understand that right?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Doctor Karll hesitates, unsure where you're going with this. "Y-yes, I understand, that is why-"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Your voice is a low whisper now. "With this… [i]arrangement[/i] with the LOM… you'll eventually pay off the bail for your son, right?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"What if I just… delayed the process a little longer."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The doctor still doesn't quite seem to get it. You decide to be more specific.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I'll keep your secret with me… but in exchange I would like to have a cut of your profits. Not too much - just a little. You'll eventually get enough to pay off the bail, but I'm sure your son can survive just another 1 or 2 months in prison…"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Doctor Karll is taken aback by your proposition. There is now some semblance of hatred in the fear and sadness he exudes, clearly targeted at you. "C-commander, are you suggesting-"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Oh, isn't that Ms ${doctor} right there?" you point towards the brown haired lady who just entered the cafeteria for lunch. "I'm rather close with her, she's been doing a fantastic job in nursing me back to health… I wonder what she would do if she knew what you were doing?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Doctor Karll's face is now red with anger, though you know he poses no threat to you; you have the advantage, you hold the high ground.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You extend your hand, proposing a handshake. 		Gritting his teeth, the poor doctor unwillingly shakes it, palming you $300.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You swiftly pocket the cash. "Pleasure doing business with you Doc, I look forward to… future dealings."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Doctor Karll, seething with anger but with no way to show it, simply mutters in a trembling voice, "Thanks, commander, I have to go now…"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		The doctor storms off, leaving you alone, $300 richer.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Any concerns about your morality are out the window. You just did something [i]undeniably fucked up[/i], and it felt… it felt like [i]something[/i], alright. You decide not to dwell on it, letting bygones be bygones. You now have an extra $300 to use as you please, and perhaps more to come in the future.

As the lift doors open, you enter the cafeteria. The delicious aroma of freshly toasted bread, savory fried chicken and perhaps a creamy mushroom soup hits you in the face. Given that its lunch time, the place is packed with doctors, nurses, visitors and patients.
*line_break
*line_break
Miraculously, ${doctor} and you find a secluded table for two. 
*line_break
*line_break
You order a fish and chips set, and a plate of spaghetti bolognese. You set the trays of food down onto the table where Sonia sits, reserving the table. 
*line_break
*line_break
The two of you begin to dig into your meals, only realizing how hungry you both were until the first bite entered your mouths. There are moments of unspoken connection you two share at this little lunch date. You occasionally look up from your meal, studying her, only to quickly avert your gaze when she looks back at you. She giggles slightly, taking her napkin to wipe away a small dollop of mayo that somehow found its way to your cheek. You sheepishly mutter something along the lines of "You didn't have to do that…" but she pretends not to hear, returning to her meal as if it had been the most normal thing to do. 
*line_break

Midway through your meals, ${doctor} quips, "So, what was it that you wanted to talk about so urgently? Or was this all just a ploy to take me on a lunch date?"
*line_break
*line_break
*if charm >= 10
	"This hardly counts as a date, Doctor. I assure you, when I do ask you out it'll be to someplace [i]far[/i] more romantic." you reply suavely. She rolls her eyes, smiling to herself, evidently impressed by your smooth reply.
*if charm < 10
	You nearly choke on your food at the suggestion. You trip over your own words trying to find a retort, but only succeed in getting more flustered. She chuckles lightly, settling you down. "Relax, I'm just teasing."
*line_break
*line_break
Secretly, you wish this light-hearted meal could continue, but you understand there are more pressing matters at the moment. You place your utensils down, and begin recounting the events of this morning to ${doctor}.
*line_break
*line_break
Her expressions turns serious, the light-hearted atmosphere unfortunately gone. "Did you manage to catch his name?"
*line_break
*line_break
"No, but I remember what he looked like. He looked like he was in his 50s, balding quite a bit, on the short side…" you do your best to describe the man as detailed as you can.
*line_break
*line_break
Doctor ${doctor} taps her chin with her index finger, contemplating. Absentmindedly she turns to look around the room. Suddenly she stops, and squints at something.  
*line_break
*line_break
"…is that him over there?" 
*line_break
*line_break
You spin around. Sure enough, there was the doctor, seated at a table by his lonesome. What's he doing here?
*line_break
*line_break
You turn back to Sonia. "Yup, that's our guy."
*line_break
*line_break
"That is Doctor Karll. He's been with us for just about a year," she informs you. "He's a little fidgety, but otherwise I thought he was a good person."
*line_break
*line_break
You turn again to get a better look at the doctor. 
*if scouting >= 1
	You notice that his coat is noticeably less chunky than it had been earlier. Where did those pills go? Surely he couldn't have traveled to the outskirts and back in the last 20 minutes?

	From this distance its difficult to make out anything beyond the identity of this Doctor Karll.

Sonia rests her head in her hand, adopting the Thinker pose. Her mind seems to be processing a millions things at once, but ultimately she struggles to find a finite answer.
*line_break
*line_break
She exhales loudly. "I don't know… if this is truly what we think it is, this is a very serious issue that should probably be brought up to the authorities. But then again, he's not exactly evil, and we might be missing some information. Maybe we should consult him ourselves first, before going to the higher ups," she thinks aloud.
*line_break
*line_break
She turns to look at you. "What do you think?"
	#Call security now. Best to let the pros handle it.
		${doctor} nods in agreement. 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"Yeah, you're right, this really is beyond either of us. Even if he had good intentions, it doesn't change the fact that what he is doing is a crime."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		She stands up. "Excuse me, I have to make a phone call."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You watch as she leaves you, heading for the entrance of the cafeteria. 2 hospital staff in gray polo shirts loiter around, security guards to keep unfit patients from entering. ${doctor} approaches the duo. A few words are exchanged, before the guards nod, moving forward slightly, keeping an eye on Doctor Karll while maintaining their distance. 
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You watch ${doctor} then walk to a corner, away from the noisy center of the cafeteria. She dials a number and begins calling… somebody.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You eat a little more of your fish and chips, which have begun to get cold. About 5 minutes later, Doctor ${doctor} rejoins you at the table.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		"I called the relevant authorities, they'll be arriving shortly. I also told the security guards to keep an eye on him until the police arrive. I notified the hospital board as well to inform them of the situation."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		You stare blankly back at her. "……so what now?"
		*line_break
		*line_break
		She shrugs. "I guess we eat, and go back to the usual."
		*line_break
		*line_break
		She turns her attention to her room-temperature spaghetti, twirling the noodles with her fork. Likewise you return to your meal. The rest of lunch is silent between the two of you. There's a palpable awkwardness in the air, and each time you feel like starting a conversation, nothing comes to mind, and you return to your meal.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		A couple of minutes pass. You and ${doctor} are just about finishing up your respective lunches, when a group of 4 burly men, dressed in navy blue police uniforms, stride briskly into the cafeteria, headed right for Doctor Karll.
		*line_break
		*line_break
		Karll panics, jumping out of his seat to run, but is immediately caught in the meaty hands of one of the policemen. There is a light scuffle as Doctor Karll struggles to break free, crying for help, but in a matter of minutes he is cuffed and taken away. There is some commotion left in the cafeteria, as people begin whispering to each other, wondering what had happened, but eventually everything returns to normal, with people going about their usual lives.
		*line_break
